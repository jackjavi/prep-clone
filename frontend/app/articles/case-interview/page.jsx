                    A&nbsp;<strong>case interview</strong>&nbsp;is part of
                    the&nbsp;job interview process in which you as the candidate
                    have to{" "}
                    <strong>
                      analyze and solve a problematic business scenario
                    </strong>{" "}
                    while interacting with the interviewer. The case study is
                    often based on a problem the interviewer has worked on in
                    real life. This part of the interview is intended to be more
                    of a dialogue. You will need to be proactive and ask
                    questions when attempting to close in on the correct
                    conclusion. Oftentimes, the consultant will attempt to guide
                    you in the correct direction by asking questions himself.

                    <strong>An example question might be</strong>:​ The CEO of
                    Deutsche Bank has become increasingly concerned about their
                    declining profitability over the last 36 months and has
                    asked you to determine the factors causing the decline as
                    well as recommend a strategy to reverse this trend.

                    rounds or more. This is dependent on the position you are
                    applying for. Most case interviews have the same underlying
                    structure. An individual case interview may take up to an
                    hour and usually consists of four parts:

                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Case interviews have always been a part of management
                    consulting interviews. Nowadays, also marketing, strategy,
                    operations, or retail positions tend to use similar formats
                    because they are a great tool{" "}
                    <strong>
                      to probe the quantitative and qualitative skills of an
                      applicant
                    </strong>
                    . It allows interviewers to get a deeper insight into how
                    you present yourself as a candidate and apply the limited
                    amount of information given to you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reason for the prevalence of the case interview format
                    in <strong>management consulting</strong> is that the topics
                    and themes handled in most cases reflect conditions close to
                    the reality of the day-to-day activities of a consultancy.
                    It requires the applicant to&nbsp;
                    <strong>ask the right questions</strong>, apply&nbsp;
                    <strong>structured frameworks,</strong>&nbsp;and think{" "}
                    <strong>outside the box</strong>. As a consultant, you will
                    spend a lot of time client-facing, and so soft skills are
                    just as important as hard skills to the interviewer. The
                    case interview allows hiring companies to ask the question
                    "Would I be happy to put this{" "}
                    <a href="/en/case-partner">candidate</a> in front of a
                    client?".​
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to the scenario set up in a case interview, it is also a
                    <strong> test of general business acumen. </strong>Many
                    consultant projects will be in{" "}

                    where the consultants aren't experts, especially junior
                    consultants. This is normal, but to be effective as a
                    consultant business acumen is an important foundation for
                    consultants to maintain effective strategy recommendations.{" "}

                    A case interview has no “correct” or “standard” answer.

                    end, what counts is your&nbsp;train of thought and how you
                    got to your solution. The interviewer will evaluate you
                    across five main areas:

                    interview, you will be presented with a wide range of
                    relevant and irrelevant data pieces. You must know how to
                    use this data to make your recommendations and you have to
                    prove that you are able to construct a logical argumentation
                    without rushing to conclusions based on insufficient

                    While the format of the first and second-round interviews
                    stays the same, the{" "}
                    <strong>seniority level of the interviewer differs</strong>.
                    The person interviewing you in the first round is usually
                    more junior, having up to four years of consulting
                    experience (Associates or Engagement Managers). The{" "}

                    <strong>Partners </strong>who have more than ten years of
                    experience and tend to drill you to understand how you cope
                    with challenges. Therefore, second rounds are{" "}
                    <strong>perceived as more difficult </strong>by candidates.
                    Since partners have a stronger voice when discussing an
                    applicant, your performance during the second round of case
                    interviews carries also more weight. For more information on

                    In <strong>candidate-led cases,</strong> the interviewer
                    expects the candidate to <strong>lead</strong> him/her
                    through the case. As a candidate, you can do so by asking
                    relevant questions, and by developing and testing your
                    hypotheses. Candidate-led cases are the most common&nbsp;

                    Case interview frameworks are the perfect tool to structure
                    your thoughts during the interview. They help you break down
                    a problem into its components so that you can{" "}
                    <strong>systematically and methodically navigate</strong>{" "}
                    through the case and the business problem. This approach
                    will convince your interviewer that you can apply your
                    skills from the case interview to the job as well.

                    should be familiar with the most common case types. Our

                      and methodically approach the case so that you not only
                      find the best answer; <strong>third</strong>, it must
                      convince your interlocutor that your success is repeatable
                      and that you will solve this case and the next and the one
                      after that.

                      When preparing for my BCG interview, I ultimately relied
                      on just two framework concepts, which I then adapted to
                      the respective case: First, a version of the{" "}
                      <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/profitability-case">
                        profitability case
                      </a>{" "}
                      <strong>
                        (Profit = Revenue - Costs and Revenue = Price x
                        Quantity)
                      </strong>
                      ; second, a <strong>basic version</strong> of: Product,
                      Price, Customer, Competition, Company).
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                      Are these two framework models optimal in every case? No,
                      they are not. Did they serve their purpose? I used them in
                      more than 10 practice cases with former BCG employees as
                      well as in my 5 BCG cases... and I succeeded, that's for
                      sure :) I would even argue that{" "}
                      <strong>
                        every case can be solved using one or both of these
                        methods
                      </strong>
                      . Learn them, keep them in your pocket, and be ready to
                      use them. If you find something better, great! But I'd
                      prefer you start with an "okay" framework and{" "}
                      <strong>focus on solving the problem</strong>, rather than
                      spending the first 30 seconds of the case trying to find
                      the "perfect" framework, failing, and feeling forced to
                      think on the fly at the beginning of the solution process.

                          are that you need to consider when formulating a

                          is to ask yourself, "If I spend time on this specific
                          topic and get some answers to my questions (e.g.,

                      2. Develop Your Business Intuition Step by Step
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since you need to have a good business sense to successfully
                    complete your case interview, you should invest some time
                    beforehand to gradually build up your business intuition.
                    The earlier you start, the easier it will become. Make it a
                    habit to regularly read business publications and magazines.
                    You can read new releases from McKinsey, Bain, and BCG, or
                    find other sources that appeal to you. Try to acquire a
                    basic understanding of economics, strategy, and industries,
                    such as retail, airlines, telecommunications, banking,
                    natural resources, and technology.

                    <strong>3. Update Your Math Skills</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For all case interviews, you must calculate without a
                    calculator. Therefore, refreshing your mental math skills
                    should be a regular part of your daily preparation plan.
                    Practice until you feel{" "}
                    <strong>one hundred percent comfortable</strong> with the
                    basic skills of addition, subtraction, division,
                    multiplication, and growth rate calculations in your head.
                    Read our article on{" "}

                    reduce the pressure.

                    Knowing shortcuts for a variety of calculations can simplify
                    mathematical problems. For example, break down{" "}
                    <strong>complex mathematical problems</strong> into several
                    small operations:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    97 x 53
                    <br />= (100 - 3) x (50 + 3)
                    <br />= 5000 + 300 - 150 - 9 = 5141

                    You can do as many cases as you want. If you don't learn

                    why you should do the following: At the end of each case you
                    complete, whether on your own, with a case partner, or with
                    an expert, write down in your own words what mistakes you
                    made and what you learned. Repeat the case after a few days
                    and apply what you've learned to ensure you're making
                    progress. Tracking your progress motivates you and ensures
                    you don't repeat the same mistakes.

                    The more you practice, the more confident you will feel.
                    However, feeling confident isn't the same as appearing
                    confident. Sometimes you can come across as insecure without
                    realizing it. This can be due to small habits in your
                    communication style. Therefore, ask your PrepLounge case
                    partner or expert to consider your verbal and non-verbal
                    communication and

                      <strong>The tone of your voice.</strong> A monotone voice
                      or speaking too quickly gives an impression of insecurity
                      and poor communication style. To avoid this, it's helpful
                      to listen to podcasts of great speakers for 30-60 minutes
                      a day. After a few days, you'll start speaking in a
                      similar manner as you adopt their communication style.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, based on our experience with other case partners,
                    you should prepare for an average of 50 hours over a period
                    of <strong>up to 6 weeks </strong>and practice daily. This
                    can be exhausting, and we know that many candidates struggle
                    with motivation and concentration, especially after an
                    intense case preparation period. This is usually because
                    they forget to incorporate regular breaks into their
                    preparation plan. Professional athletes, for example, always
                    take time to rest and allow their muscles to regenerate. You
                    should treat your brain muscles the same way. A good
                    strategy is to develop an evening and morning routine that
                    allows you to relax and increase your energy level for the
                    preparation period during the day. Here are some examples of
                    what you can do:

                    <strong>Step 4: Write out your structure.</strong>
                    <br />
                    Ask your interviewer for a minute&nbsp;to prepare your
                    structure and organize your notes. Identify your case type
                    and use an issue tree to customize your structure. The
                    branches of your issue tree should be MECE.

                    <br />
                    Now that you have set up the issue tree, your task is to
                    test each branch to see if it is the root cause of the
                    problem. Where to begin?&nbsp;A hypothesis based on an
                    educated guess helps here.&nbsp; (e.g. "Since you have
                    mentioned that revenues are more or less flat, my hypothesis
                    is that the problem is mostly driven by the cost side of the

                    <br />
                    Sharing your thoughts allows the interviewer to interact.
                    Refine or rebuild your hypothesis as you find out more.

                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Step 7: Gather more data in order to test your hypothesis.

                    Always refer to the structure you have set up at the
                    beginning of the case, but be flexible as the case evolves.
                    If you conclude that your hypothesis is false, eliminate
                    that branch and go to the next one. Summarize findings when
                    switching major branches. If your test confirms your
                    hypothesis, go deeper into that branch, and drill down to
                    the lower levels until you identify all proven root-causes.

                    Ask for a minute to gather your thoughts and then state your
                    recommendation. You need to deliver a one minute, top-down,

                  <p>
                    Don’t think too much about the&nbsp;approach&nbsp;your
                    interviewer is taking. It should not matter much if the
                    conversation is interviewer- or candidate-led. If you go
                    into your interview with a profound understanding of how to
                    handle even a difficult case, the format of the interview
                    should not be an issue. Keep a cool head and structure your
                    thoughts.
                  </p>
                  <h3>2. Ask the right questions&nbsp;</h3>
                  <p>
                    At the beginning of the case, your interviewer will present
                    you with the situation of the client. Don’t rush into the
                    analysis without developing a deep understanding of the
                    problem first. Ask your interviewer&nbsp;questions&nbsp;to
                    clarify the case. This is expected behavior that also takes
                    place later with the client. Make sure you understand what
                    the&nbsp;<strong>business model</strong>&nbsp;and your&nbsp;
                    <strong>objective</strong>&nbsp;in the respective case are
                    (regarding both money and the timeline). If there are any
                    other possible limitations you are unsure about, ask your
                    interviewer in a concise way. Asking unnecessary questions
                    will raise doubts about your ability to work efficiently
                    under pressure.

                    doing this, you are showing a fundamental comprehension of
                    the case and are emitting an aura of control, gradually
                    heading towards a solution. This technique can give you more
                    time to think. Articulating the facts of the case can also
                    be a source of clarity and allow you to form solutions more
                    quickly.

                    Do not state a hypothesis at the beginning, a stage in which

                    frameworks to their specific client’s problem, so you should

                    differ from the interviewer’s expectations. In the end, what

                      Think before you speak!

                  <p>
                    If you’re not feeling confident about your chances, don’t
                    hesitate to&nbsp;reschedule. If you take this course of
                    action, take a few things into consideration. Make sure to
                    suggest an&nbsp;alternative&nbsp;day and&nbsp;avoid
                    rescheduling multiple times&nbsp;at all costs. The
                    consultancy will be grateful for you to suggest an immediate
                    alternative. Try to be&nbsp;transparent&nbsp;as to why you
                    are rescheduling without going too deeply into details.
                    However, rescheduling should only be used as a last resort.
