        </h2>
        <p>
          The product life cycle is a way to map the common stages a product
          undergoes throughout its lifespan. The product life cycle is typically
          divided into <strong>4 different stages</strong>, each having specific
          strategic decisions affecting profits and revenues:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(1) Development: </strong>In the development phase, the
          product has just been finished and the most important facts and
          figures have been determined.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2) Introduction:&nbsp;</strong>In the first phase, the
          product is introduced. Normally, at this stage, there are a few
          competitors and&nbsp;
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/4c-framework">
            customers
          </a>
          . Therefore, sales and profit are low and the risk that the product
          will not succeed is high. In order to boost sales, the focus lies
          heavily on&nbsp;
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/4p-framework">
            promotion
          </a>
          &nbsp;activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3) Growth:&nbsp;</strong>Products that succeed in addressing
          customer’s needs will lead to an increase in sales. Advertisement is
          still a key component to promote further growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4) Maturity:&nbsp;</strong>At this stage, the product can be
          seen as well established and widely accepted within the targeted
          customer group. Profits are high and risks are low. Typically, in this
          phase,{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/competitive-response">
            competition
          </a>{" "}
          increases. To keep the market position and expand this phase,
          companies often employ strategies such as the introduction of
          complementary or updated products or simply invest in marketing
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(5) Decline:&nbsp;</strong>At this point, the product may not
          fulfill the current needs of the customers, and sales start to
          decline. The important decision at this stage is deciding when to take
          the product off market, such that the client optimizes financial gains
          and minimizes losses due to time and investment.
