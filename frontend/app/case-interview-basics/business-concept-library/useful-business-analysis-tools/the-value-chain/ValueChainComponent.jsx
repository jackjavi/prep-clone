            A value chain is used to systematically visualize processes and

          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The value chain is a classic{" "}

            framework
          </a>{" "}
          to structure the&nbsp;<strong>activities of a business</strong>. Each
          step adds value to a product by transforming resources. This&nbsp;
          <strong>value add justifies a profit margin</strong>&nbsp;at the end,
          meaning the price of the end product is higher than the sum of{" "}

          <strong>
            Michael Porter’s value chain is the most common version
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>primary activities</strong> in Porter’s value chain are
          the major contributors to value creation.
          <strong> Supporting activities</strong> are necessary to run the
          business, but not necessarily create value by themselves. These
          activities are often referred to as <strong>overhead</strong>.&nbsp;

          The above example is mainly applicable for a classic manufacturing
          process, but can also hold well for&nbsp;
          <strong>more abstract service companies</strong>, where information is
          processed. In general, a value chain could also depict an{" "}
          <strong>entire industry,&nbsp;</strong>covering the activities done by
          several companies in order to produce a complete product. Depending on
          the industry, primary and supporting activities will vary and will
          have to be&nbsp;<strong>adapted according to industry.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>
          You can use the value chain analysis both in market
          analysis&nbsp;and&nbsp;company analysis cases
        </h3>
        <p>
          On a <strong>company level</strong>, the value chain analysis is a{" "}
          <strong>powerful tool</strong>&nbsp;when you need to{" "}
          <strong>determine a root cause</strong> of a general problem in a
          structured way. It can be considered as a&nbsp;
          <strong>search pattern</strong> within a company’s or an entire
          industry’s processes. Possible <strong>business situations</strong>{" "}
          where a value chain analysis may be useful are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When there are general quality problems or increasing costs. Here
            you would lay down the primary and supporting activities. Examine
            each step to find the&nbsp;
            <strong>exact root cause of the problem</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you need to assess a <strong>business model,</strong> conduct a
            value chain analysis to figure out the{" "}
            <strong>key processes</strong> of a company, resulting in most value
            and margin.&nbsp;Here, you would define the activities that are
            the&nbsp;
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/core-competencies">
              core competencies
            </a>
            &nbsp;and secondary activities of the client and evaluate strengths
            and weaknesses (see{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/swot-analysis">
              SWOT analysis
            </a>
            ) to make more detailed recommendations.
          </li>
          <li>
            When facing logistic issues, use it to analyze all parts within a{" "}
            <strong>supply chain</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>In case of a business model redesign,&nbsp;</strong>conduct
            a&nbsp;value chain analysis to figure out what steps can be
            outsourced.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On a <strong>market level</strong>, the value chain allows you to get
          a quick overview of&nbsp;<strong>relevant players</strong>&nbsp;and
          the power of each participant. If you want to&nbsp;
          <strong>understand a product</strong>&nbsp;with respect to its
          manufacturing and its unique characteristics, follow its production
          along the value chain. In addition, if you are asked to conduct a{" "}
          <strong>profit pool analysis</strong> of an industry, you would need
          to structure it according to value chain steps. Doing so provides{" "}
          <strong>transparency</strong> about the{" "}
          <strong>attractiveness</strong> of single steps within a value chain.

        <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The value chain is a powerful tool to{" "}
            <strong>structure your analysis</strong> (since it is{" "}

            per definition).

          <li>
            It usually differentiates between{" "}

          </li>
          <li>
            It is a <strong>systematic search pattern </strong>to analyze both
