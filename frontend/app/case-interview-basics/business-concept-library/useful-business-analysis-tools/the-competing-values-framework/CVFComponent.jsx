          <strong>What is the Competing Values Framework?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Competing Values Framework (CVF) is a{" "}
          <strong>
            robust model that helps organizations better understand, assess, and
            ultimately transform their cultures
          </strong>
          .&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Competing Values Framework was developed in the 1980s. It began
          with a research study by Robert Quinn, John Rohrbaugh, and other
          colleagues aimed at identifying key indicators of organizational
          effectiveness. They conducted a factor analysis of existing
          organizational assessments and identified two main dimensions that
          formed the basis for the framework: internal vs. external and
          flexibility vs. control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quinn is co-founder of the Center for Positive Organizations at the
          Ross School of Business. His research has helped advance the concepts
          of positive organizational science, which focuses on strengthening and
          improving organizations by building positive attributes, rather than
          focusing only on fixing deficits. John Rohrbaugh is a professor in the
          Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy at the University at
          Albany, State University of New York. His research interests are in{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          Developed in the 1980s by Robert Quinn and John Rohrbaugh, the CVF has
          served as a prism for studying organizations.

            How Can the Competing Values Framework (CVF) Help to Transform
            Organisational Cultures?
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The CVF divides organizational cultures into four main quadrants:
            Clan, Adhocracy, Market, and Hierarchy.
          </strong>{" "}
          These quadrants reflect the tensions between internal and external
          factors, and between stability and control on the one hand and
          flexibility and change on the other.

              Development:&nbsp;
            </strong>
            <br />
            Clan culture is characterized by strong internal focus and
            flexibility. It is characterized by{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/the-tuckman-model">
              collaboration, participation and communication
            </a>
            . The clan quadrant is often described as an extended family where
            employees feel a high degree of loyalty and belonging. In this
            culture, the main activities are often focused on teamwork,
            consensus building, and internal harmony. The main purpose is to
            create a harmonious work environment where employees feel
            comfortable and can best utilize their skills. The typical type of
            employee in a Clan culture is team-oriented, more loyal, and
            maintains strong personal relationships in the workplace.

              Adhocracy (Creative) - "Doing things first" / Innovations:
            </strong>
            <br />
            Adhocracy is characterized by a high degree of flexibility and
            external focus. In this culture, innovation is at the core and there
            is a dynamic and entrepreneurial atmosphere. Main activities in
            Adhocracies are experimentation, risk taking and adaptation to
            change. The purpose of such a culture is to achieve competitive
            advantage through{" "}

            The Market focuses on external factors, with a high priority on
            stability and control. This culture emphasizes{" "}

            , results orientation, and performance. The main activities in
            Market cultures focus on transactions, competition, and achieving
            market goals. The purpose of this culture is to achieve market
            dominance through superior performance. The typical type of employee
            in a Market culture is results-oriented, goal-oriented, and

            The Hierarchy culture emphasizes internal factors and values
            stability and control. Here, the emphasis is on order, rules, and
            uniform procedures. The main activities in Hierarchical cultures

          <strong>Benefits and Possible Applications for Consultants</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            For consultants, the CVF provides a precise tool for analyzing their
            clients' organizational culture.
          </strong>{" "}
          It helps them understand their clients' current strengths and
          weaknesses, plan relevant changes, and design effective interventions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Knowledge of organizational culture can also help consultants
            develop customized solutions{" "}
          </strong>
          that meet the organization's specific needs and priorities. By using
          the CVF, they can determine, for example, whether an organization is
          willing to take risks and embrace{" "}
          <a href="/articles/innovation-consulting-the-turning-point">
            innovation
          </a>
          , or whether it values stability and control more.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, consultants can use the CVF to assess the impact of{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/kotter-change-management-model">
            change on the organization
          </a>
          . They can predict how a change will affect the existing culture and
          how to shape the change initiative to meet the needs and priorities of
          the organization.
