        </h2>
        <p>
          Investments or single business cases need to be evaluated based on a
          certain set of criteria. Since financial performance is the key
          criterion in a{" "}
          <a href="/articles/case-interview">case&nbsp;interview</a>, you need
          to have an idea about future financial impacts. A key tool to assess
          this impact is the cost-benefit analysis, which is used to determine
          the net effect of potential revenues and{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/fixed-variable-costs">
            costs
          </a>
          . In the case of multiple options, this net effect can be considered
          as{" "}

          of an option.

        <h2>
          A thorough cost-benefit analysis of all available alternatives is the
          foundation of every decision
        </h2>
        <p>
          Solving a case is a lot about coming up with hypotheses and then
          testing your ideas. If you have several ideas, you have to{" "}
          <strong>base your decision on analysis</strong>. Cost-benefit analysis
          helps you evaluate your ideas with respect to 1) feasibility and 2)
          relative attractiveness (comparisons,{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/benchmarking">

            The&nbsp;<strong>feasibility</strong>&nbsp;analysis covers

            <ul>
              <li>
                The&nbsp;<strong>quantitative aspect</strong>: Check the
                consequences of your decision quantitatively. E.g., determining
                <i>&nbsp;the&nbsp;</i>number of&nbsp;customers&nbsp;or prices,
                leading to the calculation of revenues and costs, and the
                corresponding&nbsp;

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Qualitative aspect:</strong>&nbsp;This might be more
                important in the final decision-making. E.g., the culture of the
                firm. Remember that even though it is more critical to quantify
                the business idea/decision in terms of&nbsp;profitability, you
                must not ignore the qualitative aspects, which often give
                insights about the implementation of decisions/ideas.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relative attractiveness</strong>&nbsp;is extremely crucial.
            Evaluate various options using a cost-benefit analysis,{" "}
            <strong>compare</strong> them all and pick the{" "}
            <strong>most attractive one&nbsp;</strong>in terms of financial
            benefits and risks (qualitative aspects).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          From a financial aspect, although it is usually neglected as it
          mathematically complicates the case solution, you can{" "}
          <strong>make your analysis more precise</strong>&nbsp;by applying
          the&nbsp;discounting concept to future income or cost streams. This is
          especially appropriate in the case of <strong>highly volatile</strong>{" "}
          <strong>streams</strong> that occur in the distant future. In such
          cases, the{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/net-present-value-npv">
            net present value
          </a>{" "}
          as the output of your cost-benefit analysis is the best metric on to
          base your decision on.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Apply the cost-benefit concept in every case, in which you need to
          make decisions

        <p>
          The cost-benefit framework is the&nbsp;<strong>basic tool</strong>
          &nbsp;for&nbsp;valuation&nbsp;and{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-basics/identifiziere-deinen-case-typen/ma">

          &nbsp;cases and you probably already apply it intuitively here. In
          addition, it works well for questions with a broad array of possible
          solutions. For example, “how can we achieve more
          revenue/growth”-questions,&nbsp;
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/market-entry">
            market entry
          </a>
          &nbsp;cases, new product cases, among others. This way, you transform
          the question into a&nbsp;profitability&nbsp;case.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> You have an ice-cream parlor and now you are
          looking for further revenue options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among other options, one is to use an ice cream truck. Assume the
          truck is used during the summer season of about 5 months or 150 days.

          <li>
            Use a cost-benefit analysis&nbsp;<strong>as a</strong>&nbsp;
