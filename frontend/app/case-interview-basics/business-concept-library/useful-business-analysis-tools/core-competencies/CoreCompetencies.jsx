            A company delivers unique value to its customers through its Core

          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          A core competency is a skill or a capability of a company that
          delivers the highest value for the customer compared to its other
          activities. The concept is related to{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/the-value-chain">
            value chain
          </a>
          , as core competencies are a sub-category of the primary activities,
          depicting the most crucial processes. In addition, a process is
          considered a core competency if the activity delivers higher value
          compared to processes of the same category from its competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          A core competency usually features the following three
          characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Challenging to be replicated</strong>&nbsp;by competitors
            because it is a result of an extensive learning period.
          </li>
          <li>
            Delivers&nbsp;<strong>unique value</strong>&nbsp;to the customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Can be applied to<strong>&nbsp;the majority of products</strong>
            &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>markets</strong>&nbsp;of the company.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            Use the strategic advantages&nbsp;of core competencies to set up a
            strategy
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Core competencies are an opposite approach to&nbsp;

            Porter’s five forces
          </a>
          , which focus on the external environment as a key factor, which
          drives decisions. The Core Competency concept uses companies’&nbsp;
          <strong>internal&nbsp;capabilities&nbsp;</strong>as drivers for
          strategic choices.

          <strong>Apple’s approach (example)</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Apple's core competencies:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Design: Life-style design</li>
          <li>Technology: Product differentiation through innovation</li>

            Marketing:
            <ul>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Secrecy about new products</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Apple's focus on areas where it can deliver the best value has
          resulted in a set of very loyal customers, and it is unlikely to
          convince Apple customers to switch to a competitor's product.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, it is crucial for a company to have a core competency and
          leverage this strength to be successful.&nbsp;
