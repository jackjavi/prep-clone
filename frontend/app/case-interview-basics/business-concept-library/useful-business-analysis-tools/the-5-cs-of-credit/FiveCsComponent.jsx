        </h3>
        <p>
          The 5 Cs of the credit framework are used to estimate the potential
          risk of a credit to a certain borrower. The 5 Cs of credit concept
          does not have to be applied very often in consulting interviews in its
          pure-play form. Even if it is not one of the "must-have" skills, it is
          still worth looking at this concept. Especially if you are from a
          finance background or if you're applying at a consultancy with a
          strong financial services focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will now go over these 5 factors in more detail – while you
          probably won’t need to learn all the factors by heart, knowing just
          the names of the 5 factors is probably the{" "}

        <h3>
          <strong>Character:</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Character is a&nbsp;<strong>subjective judgment</strong>&nbsp;about
          the potential borrower. Factors that are taken into account can
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>First impression</li>
          <li>Reputation of the borrower</li>
          <li>Know-how and experience</li>
          <li>References and background</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Capacity:</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Capacity might&nbsp;<strong>objectively</strong>&nbsp;be&nbsp;the
          <strong>&nbsp;most important</strong>&nbsp;factor because it refers to
          the&nbsp;<strong>ability</strong>&nbsp;of a potential borrower
          to&nbsp;<strong>pay</strong>&nbsp;the loan&nbsp;<strong>back</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Factors include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cash position/expected{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/cash-flow-statement">
              cash flows
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>Revenue and expenses</li>
          <li>Credit history</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Capital:</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          In this context,&nbsp;<strong>capital</strong>&nbsp;is the amount the
          potential&nbsp;<strong>borrower has invested</strong>&nbsp;in the
          business/company. It is normally an indicator of how much the borrower
          is involved in the company and how much he/she has to lose if the
          investment fails. A higher (relative) capital investment of a
          potential borrower usually means more alignment with the incentives of
          the lender and the borrower.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Collateral:</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Guarantees</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;
          <strong>other forms of security</strong>&nbsp;the potential borrowers
          can offer are known as collateral. These forms of security can
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Buildings</li>
          <li>Equipment</li>
          <li>The owner's private properties</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Conditions:</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Conditions are two-folded and include the{" "}
          <strong>overall economic environment</strong> and the&nbsp;
          <strong>intended purpose of the loan</strong>. As a rule of thumb, the
          economic circumstances, in general, are less favorable for a potential
          borrower if the economy is in a downturn/recession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taken together, these five factors usually give&nbsp;a reliable
          picture&nbsp;of the creditworthiness of a buyer from a qualitative and
          quantitative point of view.
