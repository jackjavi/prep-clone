        <p>
          We will now go over each of the four branches in more detail and
          provide examples.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Strengths</strong>&nbsp;(Internal positive factors)
        </h3>
        <p>
          The strengths of a company are its resources and capabilities, for
          example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Image/Goodwill</li>
          <li>Financial resources</li>
          <li>Technology</li>
          <li>Know-how</li>
          <li>Patents</li>
          <li>Customers</li>
          <li>Access to networks, natural resources</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Weaknesses</strong>&nbsp;(Internal negative factors)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Weaknesses can usually be viewed as the absence of specific strengths
          or things that are done better by competitors, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Poor reputation</li>
          <li>
            High{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/fixed-variable-costs">
              cost
            </a>{" "}
            structure
          </li>
          <li>Lack of customer/employee loyalty</li>
          <li>Lack of innovative R&amp;D</li>
          <li>
            Lack of access to key distribution channels/resources/trade
            associations
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Opportunities</strong>&nbsp;(External positive factors)
        </h3>
        <p>Opportunities reveal new options for growth in profits including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New technologies</li>
          <li>Removing barriers to trade</li>
          <li>Loosening of regulations</li>
          <li>Entry into new markets</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Threats</strong>&nbsp;(External negative factors)
        </h3>
        <p>
          External changes that will have a negative effect on growth and profit
          are threats, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A shift in customers’ needs, expectations, and taste away from the
            core of the companies products
          </li>
          <li>New regulations</li>
          <li>
            Neutral factors like this can also be opportunities if they are
            beneficial to the company
          </li>
          <li>
            Especially with external factors like these, it is important to set
            it into the context of the respective company
          </li>
          <li>New market entrants/low barriers to entry</li>
          <li>
            Emergence of a substitute product (see{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/porters-five-forces">
              Porter's Five Forces
            </a>
            )
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          Once you have completed the SWOT analysis, draw insights into the
          matrix
        </h2>
        <p>
          After lining out the gathered information in a simple 2x2 Matrix
          <u>,</u>&nbsp;step further by identifying strategies that address the
          following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How to use strengths to take advantage of the opportunities.</li>
          <li>How to take advantage of the strengths to avoid threats.</li>
          <li>How to use opportunities to overcome weaknesses.</li>
          <li>How to minimize weaknesses and avoid them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The SWOT matrix is a simple analysis of internal strengths and
            weaknesses as well as external opportunities and threats.
          </li>
          <li>Opportunities can be seen as threats and vice versa.</li>
          <li>
            SWOT matrices don’t show the interrelationship between internal and
            external factors.
          </li>
          <li>
            The SWOT analysis itself does not allow us to make strategic
            decisions but can be used for meaningful insights.
          </li>
