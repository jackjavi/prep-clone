            A Break-Even Analysis Helps Determine the Point at Which Total

          A break-even analysis helps to determine the number of&nbsp;
          <strong>product</strong>&nbsp;
          <strong>
            units that need to be sold for a business to be profitable,
          </strong>
          &nbsp;knowing the price and the cost of the product. It is crucial to
          understand the concept of&nbsp;
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/fixed-variable-costs">
            fixed and variable costs
          </a>
          &nbsp;to correctly calculate the break-even point during your{" "}
          <a href="/articles/case-interview">case interview</a>, but also in
          your daily work as a consultant.&nbsp;If the fixed costs are greater
          than zero, then it is important to have a positive contribution margin
          per unit (i.e. price&gt;variable costs) to reach a break-even point at
          all.
        </p>
        <h2>
          A break-even analysis helps&nbsp;illustrate the relationship between
          profits, revenues, and costs

        <p>
          Because of the&nbsp;<strong>positive contribution</strong>{" "}
          <strong>margin,</strong> the slope of the{" "}
          <strong>revenue line is steeper</strong> than the slope of the{" "}
          <strong>total costs line</strong>. Therefore, revenue per unit is
          higher than cost per unit. If there were no fixed costs, then
          obviously the business would be profitable from the beginning. In the
          example shown above, the costs involved when zero units are sold are
          the fixed costs only. To{" "}
          <strong>cover these fixed costs,&nbsp;</strong>the business needs
          to&nbsp;<strong>sell a certain&nbsp;number of units</strong>
          &nbsp;to&nbsp;reach this&nbsp;<strong>break-even point&nbsp;</strong>
          or cover the fixed costs.&nbsp;

        <h2>
          High break-even points usually suggest that a business could benefit
          from economies of scale
        </h2>
        <p>
          A detailed break-even analysis can provide some{" "}
          <strong>insight</strong> <strong>regarding the economics</strong> of a
          certain project or the entire industry. Imagine you come across a
          business that has a high break-even point, since the business needs to
          sell a lot of products to become profitable (e.g., Intel). This
          scenario is usually due to&nbsp;<strong>large fixed costs</strong>{" "}
          (so-called asset-heavy industries) which need to be covered by high
          product sales. In such situations,{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/economy-of-scale-and-economy-of-scope">
            economies of scale
          </a>{" "}
          play a major role:&nbsp;The more units you sell, the more you cover
          the fixed costs. In addition, due to the experience/learning curve,
          you tend to have fewer variable costs&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;more
          control&nbsp;over{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/pricing">
            prices
          </a>
          . Also, high fixed costs are a serious <strong>entry barrier</strong>{" "}
          for new competitors (see{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/porters-five-forces">
            Porter's Five Forces
          </a>{" "}
          for more details).
        </p>
        <h2>Apply the break-even analysis in weak profitability situations</h2>
        <p>
          For instance, your client is operating at increasing losses even
          though revenues have increased. You find that the issue is increased
          costs because of a&nbsp;<strong>newly opened factory</strong>.
          The&nbsp;
          <strong>additional fixed costs are still higher&nbsp;</strong>than the
          gain in revenues, leading to losses.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, we can start by hypothesizing the need to
          <strong> increase revenues</strong>&nbsp;to fix profitability. In this
          scenario, it would make sense to check the break-even number of units
          sold before recommending increased marketing efforts.&nbsp;For a
          break-even analysis, you need to have information such as fixed
          costs,&nbsp;variable costs,&nbsp;and price.

          <u>Required data</u>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Yearly fixed costs: $50m</li>
          <li>Average variable cost/product: $1000</li>
          <li>Average price/product: $1500</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <u>Calculation</u>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Profit/product: $1,500 - $1,000 = $500</li>

            Break-even point
            <ul>
              <li>$500 * x units = $50m</li>
              <li>x units = 100,000</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As a result, the factory needs to produce and sell 100,000 units. Make
          sure to check its feasibility and if infeasible, your advice could be
          to&nbsp;<strong>divest the new factory</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the break-even point, a business has{" "}
            <strong>no net gain/loss</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            To determine the break-even point, you will need a&nbsp;
            <strong>breakdown of the costs and revenues</strong>&nbsp;of the
            product.
