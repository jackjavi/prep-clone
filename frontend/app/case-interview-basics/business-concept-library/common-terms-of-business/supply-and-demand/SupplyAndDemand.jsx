            All markets have a supply and a demand side, leading to an

        </h2>
        <p>
          The supply and demand of products is a{" "}
          <strong>key concept in economics</strong>. Briefly, the law of supply
          and demand states that the availability of a product (supply) and its
          desire (demand) has a direct effect on the{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/pricing">
            pricing
          </a>
          . Accordingly, if the supply is low and demand is high, prices are
          high and <i>vice versa</i>. This law is true for most products in the
          market, which can be applied in most market-relevant&nbsp;
          <a href="/articles/case-interview">case interviews</a>.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            In a perfect market, demand and supply coincide at a zero-profit
            price
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp;A<strong>&nbsp;perfect market</strong>&nbsp;has the following
          characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All goods of a kind are equal (e.g., commodities).</li>
          <li>
            No transaction costs exist (e.g., taxes, cost to negotiate a
            contract, and to change a supplier).
          </li>
          <li>
            Many{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/competitive-response">
              competitors
            </a>{" "}
            exist.
          </li>
          <li>Everyone has the same information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For each of the&nbsp;<strong>two market participants</strong>, a
          consumer, and a producer, it is assumed that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The lower the price for a product, the more consumers can afford it
            and want to buy it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The lower the price for a product, the fewer producers want to sell
            it, as the profits are lower.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Based on the above assumptions, the following leads to a{" "}
          <strong>market equilibrium</strong>:
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is too much supply for a good compared to quantity demand,
          some producers will not be able to sell, leading to a “surplus”.&nbsp;
          Thus, those suppliers lower their prices to attract customers, leading
          to a price war as their competition usually also starts to lower
          prices.&nbsp;This phenomenon leads to some competitors leaving the
          market because they realize that they are not profitable anymore with
          lower prices. Now, because of lower prices, customers demand more of
          the product, and the demand increases, making the market attractive.
          Thus, new competitors{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/market-entry">
            enter the market
          </a>
          . These events continue until the supply and demand{" "}
          <strong>match perfectly in an ideal world</strong>.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          For an individual company, the concept of supply and demand is bad
          news because&nbsp;<strong>companies work at zero profit</strong>. The
          constant&nbsp;<strong>threat of a few companies</strong>&nbsp;being
          cheaper than the competitors and therefore attracting
          all&nbsp;customers&nbsp;forces the rest of the competition to work at
          the lowest possible margin. In other words, an individual&nbsp;
          <strong>company cannot set its own price</strong>&nbsp;different from
          the market price, as this would cause&nbsp;either having no customers
          (higher price) or the competition doing the same (lower price).

          <strong>
            No market is perfect in the real world and companies are able to
            make profits by leveraging imperfections
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Due to&nbsp;<strong>imperfections of the market,</strong>&nbsp;the
          concept’s validity is restricted.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All products of a kind are not equal.</li>
          <li>
            Transaction costs do exist (e.g., taxes, cost to negotiate a
            contract, and to change a supplier).
          </li>
          <li>Sometimes, an industry has only a few competitors.</li>
          <li>And no one has the same information and knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The more imperfections exist in a market or industry, the more&nbsp;
          <strong>potential exploitation</strong>&nbsp;is possible.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Product differentiation leads to low comparability. Customers have
            difficulties assigning a price to a specific level of value and
            might pay too much.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transaction costs make it difficult for customers to change a
            producer. They have to search for alternatives, which induce costs.
            They might just pay more instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            A few competitors leave chances for cartels. A monopoly is a
            company’s dream condition, as it can dictate prices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Opaque information is another barrier to the comparability of
            products, as customers don't know if they get what they paid for.
            Research knowledge leads to inventions that generate a competitive
            advantage others cannot use.
