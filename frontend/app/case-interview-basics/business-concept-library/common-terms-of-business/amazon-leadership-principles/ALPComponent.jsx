            The Amazon Leadership Principles Guide consists of sixteen
            interwoven principles that serve as the company's moral code

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Customer Obsession:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            The customer isn't just king – they're the kingdom. This principle
            urges leaders to start with the customer's needs, exceed their
            expectations, and cultivate a fanatical devotion to their
            satisfaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ownership:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Leaders at Amazon don't just manage – they own their decisions,
            actions, and the results. They're not afraid to take the reins and
            ride towards solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Invent and Simplify:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Imagine if innovation had a lovechild with efficiency – that's what
            this principle embodies. Leaders are encouraged to dream up
            ingenious solutions and then distill them into elegant simplicity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Are Right, A Lot:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Good decisions are the foundation of success. This principle nudges
            leaders to sharpen their judgment, seek diverse viewpoints, and be
            unafraid to alter course.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Learn and Be Curious:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            At Amazon, the quest for knowledge is never-ending. Leaders embrace
            curiosity, evolve, and{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/servant-leadership">
              inspire their teams
            </a>{" "}
            to keep learning and growing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hire and Develop the Best:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Building a powerhouse starts with hiring exceptional talent and
            nurturing their growth. Leaders raise the bar, striving for
            excellence in every recruit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Insist on the Highest Standards:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Mediocrity is an alien concept at Amazon. Leaders push the envelope
            by setting sky-high standards that shape the company's ethos.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Think Big:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Dreamers and visionaries thrive under this principle. Leaders don't
            just think outside the box – they{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/the-blue-ocean-strategy">
              create entirely new boxes
            </a>
            .
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bias for Action:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            The tortoise might win some races, but at Amazon, the hare's got the
            upper hand. Leaders take calculated risks, embracing agility and
            seizing opportunities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frugality:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            This isn't about penny-pinching; it's about efficiency and
            resourcefulness. Leaders optimize and innovate, squeezing more from
            every resource.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Earn Trust:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Trust isn't just earned – it's nurtured through transparency,
            respect, and accountability. Leaders lead by example, building
            bridges of trust within teams and beyond.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dive Deep:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Skimming the surface won't cut it at Amazon. Leaders dive headfirst
            into data, exploring the depths to make informed decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Healthy disagreement is the spark of innovation. Leaders{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/interpersonal-communication">
              speak their minds
            </a>
            , challenge assumptions, and then rally behind the chosen path.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deliver Results:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Intentions are nice, but results are essential. Leaders focus on
            outcomes, driving teams towards success with precision and
            determination.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Strive to Be Earth's Best Employer:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Employees are the foundation of any organization. Leaders create a
            nurturing environment where people flourish, innovate, and feel
            valued.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Leaders understand their impact reaches far beyond their role. They
            champion ethical conduct, social responsibility, and sustainability.
          </li>
        </ol>
