          Design Thinking is more than just an approach or a method â€“ it's a{" "}

            non-linear, iterative process that places creativity and
            problem-solving at its core

          . To understand this mindset, let's look at the three essential
          elements of Design Thinking:{" "}
          <strong>People, Process, and Place</strong>. These elements form the
          foundation for applying Design Thinking in business consulting.

        <h3>
          <strong>The Evolution of Design Thinking</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Originally emerging in the creative environments of design studios,
          Design Thinking began to establish itself as an approach to{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/issue-tree">
            creative problem-solving
          </a>{" "}
          in the 1960s and 1970s. Rolf Faste, a professor at Stanford
          University, coined the term "Design Thinking" in the 1980s. Evolving
          from a purely design-focused approach, Design Thinking has become an
          interdisciplinary method that extends far beyond the boundaries of
          traditional design. Companies and organizations have recognized that
          this mindset is applicable not only to product development but also to
          complex systems, services,{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          and social innovations.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>The Three Elements of Design Thinking</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1) People: The key roles of individuals</strong>
          <br />
          Design Thinking focuses on people, their needs, and perspectives.
          People are at the center of the development process, whether it's
          designing products, services, or corporate strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2) Process: Six iterative steps</strong>

            <strong>Prototype:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Build tangible representations of selected ideas to evaluate their
            feasibility and impact.

            <strong>Implement:</strong>&nbsp;

            Execute the chosen solution, emphasizing that the success of design
            thinking relies on translating ideas into tangible outcomes that
            positively impact users' lives.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>3) Place: The space for creativity</strong>
          <br />
          The physical and social space where Design Thinking takes place also
          plays a crucial role. Open and collaborative spaces encourage the
          exchange of ideas and{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/interpersonal-communication">
            facilitate effective collaboration
          </a>
          . Special workshops or Design Thinking labs can create a space that
          fosters creativity and innovation.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Key Insights into Design Thinking</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Design Thinking is a powerful mindset that has successfully
          established itself in various areas. Emphasizing People, Process, and
          Place allows for the development of creative solutions that not only
          are functional but also place the needs of people at the forefront.
          The iterative application of the six steps provides a structured path
          from defining the problem to thoughtful prototypes and ultimately to
          innovative solutions.
