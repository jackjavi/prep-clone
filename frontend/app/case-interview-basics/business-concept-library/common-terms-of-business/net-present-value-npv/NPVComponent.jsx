          <strong>Definition of the Net Present Value (NPV)</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The net present value (NPV) allows you to evaluate future cash flows
          based on the present value of money. It is the{" "}
          <strong>sum of present values</strong>&nbsp;of money in different
          future points in time. The present value (PV) determines how much
          <strong> future money is worth today</strong>. Based on the net
          present valuation, we can&nbsp;<strong>compare</strong> a
          <strong> set of projects/ investments</strong> with different{" "}

            Time Value of Money – An Intuitive and Financial Explanation
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The closer future cash flows are to the present, the more valuable
          your money is. The concept is also known as the&nbsp;
          <strong>time value of money&nbsp;</strong>and we provide two
          explanations below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An <strong>intuitive</strong> explanation: People will prefer money
            at present because of <strong>risk aversion</strong>. Would you
            rather have $100 today or in a year? Obviously today, because there
            is a risk that you may not get that $100 in a year. In addition,
            once you have the money, you again have a decision to either spend
            right away or wait to spend
          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong>financial</strong> explanation: Imagine you have $100. How
            much is it worth in a year? If you do not leave the money in your
            pocket, you usually have the option to put the money in your bank
            account at low and almost negligible risk. You will&nbsp;
            <strong>earn interest&nbsp;</strong>but&nbsp;may lose value due to
            inflation. However, the inflation-adjusted interest rate may be 2%,
            in absolute terms $2. In total your $100 is worth $102 after one
            year. Now, you can calculate backwards: If you have a future value
            of $102 in a year, how much is it worth today? It is $102 divided by
            1.02 which results in $100 again.

          <strong>Apply NPV Shortcuts to Succeed in Case Situations</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          It’s <strong>unlikely</strong> that you will need to&nbsp;
          <strong>calculate a complex NPV</strong> during a{" "}
          <a href="/articles/case-interview">case interview</a> because the
          calculations tend to get overly complicated. But&nbsp;in some cases
          you can apply some shortcuts as discussed below:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            1. Perpetuity: the NPV for infinite cash flows (meaning business
            will generate profits for an infinite period of time)
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>For infinite cash flows, there is a simplified formula:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img
            src="/uploads/bootcamp/images/12%20Net%20Present%20Value%208_Gr%C3%B6%C3%9Fe%20angepasst%281%29.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </figure>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Imagine you have to{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/valuation">
            <u>value a company</u>
          </a>
          &nbsp;in a case interview. A common approach is to define the value of
          a company as the{" "}
          <strong>sum of all its discounted future profits</strong>. If you
          assume that a company will have the same profits every year for an
          indefinite time horizon, you just divide the future value of all
          profits by the respective discount rate. For instance, if you expect
          the company to yield $100 every year, the company is worth $2500 (at a
          discount rate of 4%).
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img

            alt=""

        </figure>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          To make this more pragmatic, you could assume that the company's
          profits will <strong>grow every year</strong> at a certain rate, g.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </figure>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Especially&nbsp;for short-term horizons, defining expected growth is
          difficult. An approximated&nbsp;

          for profits that are far into the future is often around{" "}
          <strong>2%</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;After a while, every
          business or&nbsp;

            product life cycle
          </a>
          &nbsp;ends up in a <strong>competitive market environment</strong> and
          simply grows&nbsp;at the{" "}
          <strong>same rate as the overall economy</strong>. The above example
          recalculated with a continuous growth rate of 2% results in a{" "}
          <strong>net present value</strong> of $5000 for the company.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice that the value is<strong>&nbsp;twice</strong> the value
          compared to the calculations without a growth. NPV calculations are
          very <strong>sensitive</strong> towards changes in inputs. Therefore,
          a sensitivity analysis is conducted in most cases. To do so, you need
          to create a range of possible NPVs by using a range of possible growth
          and discount rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Find the right interest rate</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding the correct discounting factor for NPV calculations is the
          business of entire banking departments. In general, there is one basic
          rule:{" "}
          <strong>the bigger the risk, the higher the discount rate.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The rationale behind this rule is simple: The less you can be sure
          about receiving future earnings, the less you value them. By{" "}
          <strong>increasing the discount rate,</strong> the{" "}
          <strong>NPV</strong> of future earnings will&nbsp;
          <strong>shrink</strong>. Discount rates for quite secure cash-streams
          vary between 1% and 3%, but for most companies, you use a discount
          rate between 4% - 10%, and for speculative start-up investment, the
          applied interest rate could reach up to 40%. In case interviews, you
          could ask for the discount rate directly or estimate it at 10% for
          most scenarios if the interviewer requests you to approximate
          it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Why Is The NPV Used By Companies?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The NPV is a strong indicator for companies to determine whether a
          project is profitable or not. As it considers the interest rate and
          inflation rate (which are usually equal to one another),
          <strong>
            {" "}
            the real value of money at every year of the project
          </strong>{" "}
          can be considered. If the calculated NPV is positive, the company can
          argue that the project or investment will be profitable since the
          earnings generated exceed the costs, all calculated in the present
          value of dollars. On the other side, if the calculated NPV is
          negative, it is an indicator for a company to step back from an
          investment o project since it will result in a net loss. Thus, the NPV
          can be a valuable tool for companies to evaluate whether to invest in
          a project or not.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Advantages of The Net Present Value</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Net Present Value (NPV) offers many advantages, all of which relate to
          the <strong>accuracy of the calculation</strong> in determining the{" "}
          <strong>
            actual value of a future amount of money under present conditions
          </strong>
          . The measurement is based on the time value of money theory, which
          indicates that a given amount of money is worth more now than the same
          amount of money in the future. Inflation rates and the rates at which
          invested money can grow in the future combine to form a discount rate
          that devalues future money. Because the discount rate is considered in
          the calculation, one of the main advantages of NPV is that it allows{" "}
          <strong>important financial decisions to be made</strong>
          .&nbsp;Business decisions are difficult to make at any scale, from
          deciding on a key purchase to deciding on a costly new project. It can
          be foolish to make these decisions without first considering the
          impact of time on money. For this reason, a calculation that takes
          into account the <strong>relationship between time and money</strong>,
          which is one of the main advantages of NPV, is critical.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The perhaps most important advantage of the present value is its{" "}
          <strong>usefulness in a business decision</strong>. Once the NPV is
          calculated, the company making the decision needs to only c
          <strong>ompare current costs with the NPV</strong>. For example, a
          company that has the opportunity to purchase a new factory for
          $100,000 (USD) should only proceed with the purchase if the present
          value of future cash flows is greater than $100,000. Otherwise, it
          would be better for the company to invest the money elsewhere.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Limitations of The Net Present Value</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          In practice, the concept of net present value is common and is used
          oftentimes. Nevertheless, there are{" "}
          <strong>disadvantages and limitations</strong> of this key figure. For
          example, the calculated value is based on various assumptions. If one
          or more assumptions do not materialize in practice, the net present
          value and the actual benefit of an investment may differ. At the same
          time, the concept is{" "}
          <strong>susceptible to influence by the valuer</strong>. Individual
          assumptions can theoretically be changed until the{" "}
          <strong>result matches the expectations</strong> of the valuer.
          Consequently, the net present value has the highest informative value
          when an investor calculates it himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: A company examines the benefits of investing in a new
          production line. The company assumes that the machine will be used for
          ten years and consequently plans with ten periods to determine the net
          present value. However, after seven years, customers no longer demand
          the product that has been produced. The production line has to be
          discarded in favor of a new machine. The originally calculated net
          present value is significantly lower than originally assumed due to
          the change in the utilization period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the net present value is a comprehensive concept, the{" "}
          <strong>secondary effects</strong> of an investment are not taken into
          account. The cash flow series used relates directly to the investment
          examined. The net present value cannot measure{" "}
          <strong>synergy effects</strong> in other parts of the company or, for
          example, an <strong>improved corporate image</strong>.
        </p>
