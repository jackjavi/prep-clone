          <strong>
            Opportunity costs can be seen as the price paid for making a certain
            business decision
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Opportunity costs are an economic concept to quantify benefits of
          alternatives that were ignored while making a decision. Precisely,
          opportunity costs are&nbsp;the{" "}
          <strong>value of the best alternative</strong> that was{" "}
          <strong>not chosen</strong>.&nbsp;For example:&nbsp;in a{" "}
          <a href="/articles/case-interview">case interview</a>, as a part of a
          business solution for a food&nbsp;supermarket,&nbsp;you recommend to
          use a share&nbsp;of the space for pre-prepared food items instead of a
          small restaurant (best alternative). Here, opportunity costs would be
          the revenues that would have been made by utilizing the space for the
          small restaurant instead of pre-prepared food items. Make sure to
          mention this in the interview and calculate the{" "}
          <strong>lost revenues</strong> in opportunity costs if necessary.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            Opportunity costs are required to determine the&nbsp;attractiveness
            of various options&nbsp;
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most options will be<strong>&nbsp;mutually exclusive </strong>(see{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/mece-principle">
            MECE
          </a>
          )<strong>. </strong>Thus,&nbsp;
          <strong>
            deciding on one option usually means forgoing an alternative
          </strong>
          . Note that the the basic principle is <strong>always</strong>
          &nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>go for the option</strong> with the&nbsp;
          <strong>highest opportunity costs</strong> since this option would be
          the most expensive if it is ignored.&nbsp;<strong> </strong>In the
          previous example of a small restaurant <i>vs. </i>pre-prepared food,
          we assumed the opportunity costs of pre-prepared food to be higher
          than of a&nbsp;small restaurant.&nbsp;Since the option with the
          highest opportunity costs is chosen, the net effect on business is
          still beneficial (expected revenues from pre-prepared food items MINUS
          expected revenues from small restaurant).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Opportunity costs are closely related to&nbsp;discounting, which is a
          standard procedure utilized in finance. The discounting rate depicts
          the opportunity costs of investing the money for a certain interest
          rate somewhere else. Think about why we choose a discount rate of
          5%.&nbsp;This is because we could opt for another investment (same
          risk-return ratio) that yields 5% as an alternative.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Consider opportunity costs for every decision made</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Remember, every action or inaction is a decision at the end of the
          day. Opportunity costs occur whenever you&nbsp;<strong>make a</strong>
          &nbsp;<strong>decision</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Keep in mind
          that all your actions, including the trivial “not doing anything”,
          lead to costs since you forgo benefits of alternative decisions.
          Therefore, always make your entire option space transparent and rate
          your options based on opportunity costs because doing so will help you
          make the right decision. Through the calculation of opportunity costs
          you are able to conduct a valid like-for-like{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/benchmarking">
            benchmarking
          </a>{" "}
          and pick the best option.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a&nbsp;<strong>case interview,&nbsp;</strong>you will need to use
          the concept of opportunity costs in cases that involve&nbsp;

          or{" "}

            M&amp;A
          </a>{" "}
          situations since in these cases you often need to determine
          client's&nbsp;<strong>willingness to pay</strong> for certain
          companies. The willingness to pay is mainly determined by the options
          you have and the associated opportunity costs.

        <h3>
          <strong>
            Below are two business case examples on how you can incorporate
            opportunity costs in the decision-making process
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Business case: investment</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assume you have $100,000 and you are offered an investment which has
            a return of 10% after one year. This means you will earn $10,000 in
            year 1. You need to decide against this investment. What are the
            opportunity costs of this decision?
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, you need to evaluate the next best option. If you leave the
            money at home, you don’t earn anything and after a year, you still
            have $100,000 instead of $110,000. Thus, the opportunity costs of
            your decision are $10,000. But&nbsp;if you deposit the money in a
            bank and earn 2% interest, you actually would have $102,000 in your
            account after a year and opportunity costs in this case would be
            &nbsp;$8,000 ($ 10000 - $ 2000).
          </li>
          <li>
            See this example from another perspective in&nbsp;
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/net-present-value-npv">
              discounting
            </a>
            .
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Business case: production</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assume your client produces fabrics. A square meter of fabric costs
            $8 in production and it can be sold for $10 at a profit of $2. The
            client decides to build another factory which produces clothes.
            Instead of selling the fabric on the market, the client passes it on
            to the new factory. Total costs of production for clothes (which
            need 1 square meter) are $13 ($8 + $5)&nbsp;and they sell them for
            $16 with a profit of $3. What are the opportunity costs of this
            idea?
          </li>
          <li>
            Since the client has foregone his profit from selling the fabric,
            his opportunity costs are $2. In this case however, the new idea
            seems to be the better one as the client generates higher profits.
            Opportunity costs are still important, for example if you want to
            define the value and{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/profitability-case">
              profitability
            </a>{" "}
            of the idea: Opening a new factory will generate $1 ($3 - $2) after
            taking opportunity costs into consideration.
