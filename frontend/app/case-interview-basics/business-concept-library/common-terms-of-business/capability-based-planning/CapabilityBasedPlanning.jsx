          <strong>Origin and Background</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          CBP originated from military planning approaches and has evolved into
          the business world. This method emphasizes the importance of
          organizational capabilities over traditional resources such as
          personnel and technology. The focus is on what an organization can
          effectively do to achieve its strategic goals.

        <h3>
          <strong>Phases of Capability-Based Planning</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are <strong>five phases</strong> that are divided into CBP:

          />
        </figure>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Phase 1: Definition of Business Strategy</strong>
            <br />
            The first step involves defining a clear and precise business
            strategy. This strategy should encompass the organization's
            long-term goals and the path to achieving these goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phase 2: Identification of Core Capabilities</strong>
            <br />
            Once the business strategy is set, the core capabilities required to
            implement this strategy need to be identified. These capabilities
            include not just technical skills but also organizational and
            procedural competences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phase 3: Assessment of Current Capabilities</strong>
            <br />
            In this phase, a thorough assessment of the organization's current
            capabilities is conducted. This involves an analysis of strengths
            and weaknesses and the gaps that need to be filled.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phase 4: Development of a Capability Plan</strong>
            <br />
            Based on the preceding analyses, a detailed plan is developed that
            outlines how to develop, improve, or acquire the necessary
            capabilities to support the business strategy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phase 5: Implementation and Monitoring</strong>
            <br />
            The final step is the implementation of the capability plan and
            continuous monitoring and adjusting of capabilities to ensure they
            align with the evolving business strategy.
          </li>
        </ul>
