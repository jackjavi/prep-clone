            Examples &amp; Limitations
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)</strong> is a really
          important tool for a consultant to compare long-term growth scenarios.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>What Is a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) </strong>is the average
          rate at which a value (e.g. business or investment) increases over a
          certain period of time.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Why Is the CAGR Important in Consulting?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Consultants often like to compare the current year's growth rate with
          the following year's growth rate (see&nbsp;
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/benchmarking">
            Benchmarking
          </a>
          ). Looking at year-over-year growth rates is often subjected to
          several one-off influencing factors. Additionally, consultants often
          have to work with&nbsp;a{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/growth-strategy">
            Growth Strategy
          </a>{" "}
          that includes a <strong>company’s goals for the future</strong>{" "}
          (usually for the next 5 years).
        </p>
        <p>
          These growth plans, in turn, consist of a set of measures, each having
          different impacts in different years. A question asked very often is:
          how much does the company grow&nbsp;<strong>on average</strong>? To
          answer this question, you need to use the CAGR. The CAGR shows the
          yearly growth of an indicator if it had grown at a steady rate Y-o-Y.

          More than likely, you will not be asked to calculate a CAGR in a&nbsp;

          what it means and also <strong>knowing the formula</strong> will get

          As an easy way to check your results during case prep, you can use the{" "}

        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>Example and Calculation</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Your interviewer gives the following graph on a{" "}
          <strong>client’s sales</strong> in the last 7 years and wants you to
          find their CAGR.
        </p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img
            src="/uploads/bootcamp/images/CAGR%20Chart%20%281%29.png"
            alt="CAGR Question Graph"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Sales in 2006 were 0.8 million Euros (beginning value). In 2013, after
          7 years, sales increased to 1.8 million Euros.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img

            alt="type-conversion-1677685356-coabjgld0a5i.webp"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          This means, if the company grew each year from 2006 onwards with a
          rate of ~12% (12.28%), sales in 2013 would be 1.8 million Euros.

          <strong>Applications and Additional Uses</strong>
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculate the average growth of a single investment</li>
          <li>Compare investments</li>
          <li>Track performance of various business measures or companies</li>

        <h4>
          <strong>The Difference Between CAGR and IRR</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Both the <strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</strong> and the CAGR
          can measure investment performances. However, the IRR is more flexible
          and a lot more difficult to calculate. Whereas you can calculate the
          CAGR by hand, the IRR ideally needs a financial calculator, excel, or
          a portfolio accounting system. The IRR is used for the evaluation of
          more complicated investments and projects with different cash inflows
          and outflows.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>Limitations and Rules of Thumb</strong>
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The CAGR does not tell you anything about the real sales in the
            years between the starting year and the end year
          </li>
          <li>
            Theoretically, it is possible that all the growth happens only in
            the first or in the last year
          </li>
          <li>
            While this is somewhat part of what is wanted when using the CAGR
            (to make growths comparable) this is also a restriction: Two
            investments can have the exact&nbsp;<strong>same CAGR</strong>
            &nbsp;but one of them can be much more favorable since the growth
            is&nbsp;<strong>faster earlier on</strong>. The&nbsp;
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/net-present-value-npv">
              NPV
            </a>
            &nbsp;(Net Present Value) is key to understand this concept.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dividing 72 by the CAGR will roughly give you the number of years to
            double the starting revenues (Rule of 72)
          </li>
          <li>
            CAGRs are most commonly used for periods of 3-7 years. For periods
            longer than 10 years, the CAGR is considered suitable only in
            special cases because, at this point, it starts to mask sub-trends.
          </li>

        <h4>
          <strong>CAGR in Excel</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          You can calculate the CAGR by using the <strong>RRI function</strong>{" "}

          <strong>Key Takeaways</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            CAGR is a theoretical&nbsp;<strong>steady growth rate</strong>
            &nbsp;over a specific amount of time
          </li>
          <li>
            CAGR is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;the&nbsp;
            <strong>average&nbsp;</strong>of the&nbsp;<strong>Y-o-Y</strong>
            &nbsp;growth rates
          </li>
          <li>
            It doesn’t reflect highs and lows and could
            <strong>&nbsp;mask sub-trends</strong>&nbsp;within the period
          </li>
          <li>
            You will probably encounter CAGR in graphs that the interviewer will
            hand out to you but you are not likely to have to calculate CAGR
            yourself
