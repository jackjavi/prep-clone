            A balance sheet provides an overview of a company’s financial
            condition
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A balance sheet, also known as the financial position
          statement,&nbsp;depicts a company's financial balance in terms of{" "}
          <strong>assets and liabilities/equity</strong>. As opposed to an{" "}

            income statement
          </a>
          , the balance sheet can be seen as a <strong>snapshot&nbsp;</strong>of
          a business's situation since&nbsp;it shows the company’s financial
          situation at a <strong>specific point in time</strong>. As a result,
          it <strong>does not allow conclusions</strong> about a{" "}
          <strong>company’s performance</strong>&nbsp;over a time period but
          rather its status at a specific time point.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            Equity and liabilities on one side and assets on the other side must
            be balanced (Equity + Liabilities = Assets)
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          A balance sheet consists of two sides:&nbsp;assets and
          equity/liabilities. As you can guess by the name, both sides should be
          balanced.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On the one side, the balance sheet lists the&nbsp;
            <strong>value of all assets</strong>&nbsp;a company owns. These can
            be tangible&nbsp;(such as cash, receivables, and&nbsp;goods)&nbsp;or
            intangible (such as brand value or patents). They are sorted in
            terms of their liquidity, which is the ease of selling them in order
            to generate cash. <strong>Current assets</strong> are very liquid
            while long-term assets, or <strong>fixed assets</strong>, are less
            liquid.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the other side, the balance sheet shows how assets of a&nbsp;
            <strong>company are financed</strong>, meaning how assets were
            acquired. They are either financed through <strong>equity</strong>,
            which is the company owner’s money, or they are financed by&nbsp;
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/the-5-cs-of-credit">
              debt
            </a>
            , which are liabilities the company owes to others.

          , the financial position is analyzed to derive an{" "}

          <strong> (financial) situation. Key ratios&nbsp;</strong>structure the
          data to compare the firm with similar competitors and provide a quick

          <strong>Analyze the balance sheet to gather critical insights</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you are given details from a balance sheet during your case, you
          can <strong>interpret</strong> the different{" "}
          <strong>components</strong>. Especially if you look at the{" "}
          <strong>development</strong> of certain figures or ratios by{" "}
          <strong>comparing data</strong> from <strong>previous years</strong>,
          you can generate useful insights.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Current Assets</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cash:</strong>&nbsp;Usually, an increasing amount of cash is
            an indication of good performance and growth. Cash reserves secure a
            company against recessions and can be used as funds for investments.
            Too much cash, on the other hand, is suspicious: It might be a
            result of extraordinary sales or it is a sign of a firm’s
            difficulties to find appropriate investments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inventory:</strong>&nbsp;Large amount of inventories cause
            storage costs. Money is tied up in products, which could be used
            otherwise for investments (see{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/opportunity-costs">
              opportunity costs
            </a>
            ). Growing inventory is often a sign of either decreasing sales or
            overcapacity in production.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Receivables:</strong>&nbsp;The faster the firm collects
            money tied up in receivables the better, as cash as opposed to
            receivables can be invested or at least generate interest.
            Furthermore, early collecting of receivables decreases the default
            risk of single&nbsp;customers. Increasing receivables can be a sign
            of more sales, but also delayed payments from customers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Non-current assets</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Includes all assets which are not current, such as real estate and
            intangible assets. Companies cannot sell their fixed assets quickly.
            They are long-term investments necessary to run a business. The
            extent of non-current assets, therefore, depends highly on the
            industry. It can be useful to check if the investments in fixed
            assets are really business-relevant or serve other purposes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Liabilities</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Current Liabilities</strong>&nbsp;are obligations, such as
            payments to suppliers. They must be paid within a short time frame.
            In the regular case, large current liabilities are not a problem as
            it is an advantage for a company if they are allowed to pay their
            bills late. However, in case of financial distress, increasing
            liabilities can become a problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-current liabilities</strong>&nbsp;are usually&nbsp;
            <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/bootcamp.php/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/the-5-cs-of-credit">
              credits
            </a>
            &nbsp;and loans given by banks or bondholders. They can be both
            advantageous and problematic. Usually, debts are cheaper capital
            since interest paid for them is less than what a company pays to
            equity holders. Interests reduce the earnings a company generates
            and thus the taxes it has to pay. However, if debts and interest are
            too high, a company might run bankrupt if they cannot pay interest.
            In addition, large debt amounts increase the dependency on the
            general development of key interest rates.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Equity</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Equity is owned by shareholders. All Assets not owned by creditors via
          obligations belong to shareholders. Therefore Equity = Total Assets –
          Total Liabilities
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Capital stock</strong>&nbsp;represents the money investors
            give when they buy shares from the company for the first time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retained earnings</strong>&nbsp;depict the earnings a
            company put aside from previous profits. A company can either
            distribute those earnings to its shareholders via dividends or keep
            them as retained earnings.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Liquidity ratios</strong>&nbsp;provide information about a
          firm’s ability to repay debts. The Cash Ratio shows to what extent a
          company’s cash and quickly sellable securities are sufficient to repay
          the debt. If the ratio is less than 1, there is not enough cash to
          repay all liabilities due in one year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Quick Ratio and Working Capital work similarly, however, more
          illiquid assets are included in these ratios:

        <p>
          <strong>Debt Ratios</strong>&nbsp;show a company’s extent of debts.
          The debt ratio gives the percentage of assets that are financed by
          debt. Leverage compares Liabilities and Equity directly but has
          basically the same meaning.

        <p>
          <strong>The Price to Book Ratio</strong>&nbsp;shows if a company is
          under or overvalued. The{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/valuation">
            market value of a firm
          </a>{" "}
          is the amount of outstanding shares times the price per share.
          Therefore, it mirrors the market’s opinion about the equity value. If
          the Price to Book Ratio is larger than one, the market values the
          company more than it is worth according to the balance sheet. The
          company might be overvalued unless other factors compensate for that
          (e.g., vast growth, customer loyalty, brand strength, etc).
