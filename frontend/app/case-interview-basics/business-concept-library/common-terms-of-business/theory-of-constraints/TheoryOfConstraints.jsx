          <strong>Theory of Constraints</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Theory of Constraints (TOC), also known as&nbsp;Bottleneck theory, was
          developed by Israeli physicist and entrepreneur Eliyahu M. Goldratt.
          This theory is a <strong>management approach</strong> that aims to
          improve{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/the-capability-maturity-model-cmm">
            organizational performance
          </a>{" "}
          by focusing on identifying and eliminating bottlenecks.&nbsp;
          <br />A bottleneck is{" "}
          <strong>a part of the production process or a resource</strong> that
          limits a company's production capacity and thus affects overall
          performance. Similar to a bottleneck that reduces the flow of a
          liquid, creating a bottleneck, certain{" "}

            factors in organizations
          </a>{" "}
          create bottlenecks that can slow, limit or prevent operations.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>1. Basic Principles Of The Theory Of Constraints</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>Bottleneck theory is based on several fundamental principles:</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img
            src="/uploads/bootcamp/113/type-conversion-1700577232-ipapf33duost.webp"
            alt="type-conversion-1700577232-ipapf33duost.webp"
          />
        </figure>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The flow principle:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            TOC emphasizes that a company's production should be designed to
            function like a continuous flow. Each step in the process should be
            matched to the speed of the bottleneck to avoid congestion and
            overproduction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identification of the bottleneck</strong>:&nbsp;
            <br />
            Identification of the bottleneck is critical. This step requires a
            detailed analysis to identify the resource or process step that has
            the highest capacity constraint.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exploitation (utilization of the bottleneck):</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            After identifying the bottleneck, the company should ensure that it
            is optimally utilized. This means that all resources and activities
            should be directed towards using the bottleneck as efficiently as
            possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Subordination:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            All other activities in the organization should be subordinate to
            the performance of the bottleneck. This means that the speed and
            output of the bottleneck determines the speed and output of the
            entire process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Elevation (Elevating the Bottleneck):</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            If the bottleneck can be permanently eliminated or its capacity can
            be increased, the elimination should also be considered to increase
            the overall performance of the company. To this end, it may also be
            profitable to invest costs to remove the bottleneck, which will
            subsequently be recouped through an improved process and improve
            production operations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>2. Examples From The Economy</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Manufacturing companies</strong>:&nbsp;
            <br />
            In the manufacturing industry, bottleneck theory is particularly
            relevant. A classic example is the production of cars. If the
            assembly line is faster than the supply of engines, production will
            be limited by the availability of engines, leading to inefficient
            labor processes and inventory. TOC would suggest optimizing the
            bottleneck, engine supply, and ensuring that it is synchronized with
            the assembly line.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Service companies:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            The bottleneck theory is also applicable in service companies. For
            example, a call center may have bottlenecks in the number of
            available customer service agents*. If calls come in faster than
            they can be handled, this leads to long waiting times and
            dissatisfied customers. TOC would suggest here to optimize the work
            capacity of the customer service team to eliminate the bottleneck.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scientific findings and studies:</strong>
            <br />
            There are numerous scientific studies and case studies that
            demonstrate the effectiveness of bottleneck theory in practice. A
            study by R. H. Lenz and S. L. Nydick in 1991, for example, found
            that companies that implemented TOC experienced significant
            improvements in lead times, inventories, and profits. This
            underlines the scientific validity of this management method.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bottleneck theory in management consulting:</strong>
            <br />
            In management consulting, bottleneck theory is often applied to help
            companies identify and eliminate bottlenecks. Consultants* analyze
            internal processes, identify bottlenecks, and then develop
            strategies for optimization. TOC provides clear guidance for
            improving operational efficiency and performance.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In summary, Eliyahu M. Goldratt's bottleneck theory is a proven
          approach to improving business performance that has been successfully
          applied in a variety of industries. Scientific research supports its
          effectiveness, and in management consulting it plays an important role
          in optimizing operations and maximizing profits.
