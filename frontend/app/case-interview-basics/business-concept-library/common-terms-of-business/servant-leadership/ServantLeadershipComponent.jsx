          <strong>Servant Leadership - A New Form of Leadership?</strong>
        </h2>
        <h3>
          <strong>The Concept of Servant Leadership</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The concept of Servant Leadership{" "}
          <strong>
            assumes that a leader is first and foremost a servant or sidekick
          </strong>
          . Sounds strange, doesn't it? People usually think that the boss or
          chief executive is the person who commands, and the others follow. But
          Servant Leadership turns that notion around.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case,{" "}
          <strong>your boss would not be the one telling you what to do</strong>
          , but the one asking you what you need to do your job well. He's there
          to remove obstacles, give you the tools you need, and make you feel
          comfortable and valued. A boss would also be someone who helps you
          develop, learn new skills, and grow as a person as well as a
          professional.{" "}
          <strong>
            His or her main role would be to support you so that you can do your
            best.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The basic assumption is based on the fact that if you do your best
          </strong>
          , the entire company will implement it as well. When all employees
          feel valued, supported and motivated, they are more engaged,
          productive and creative. They contribute more ideas, collaborate
          better, and are sick less often. And all of this is, of course, good
          for the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          That, in simple terms, is what Servant Leadership is all about. It's
          not about exercising power, it's about serving. And by serving, the
          leader ultimately helps the whole company become better.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Where Does the Term Servant Leadership Come From?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The term Servant Leadership was{" "}
          <strong>coined by Robert K. Greenleaf</strong> in the essay "The
          Servant as Leader" (1970). Greenleaf was not a typical businessman,
          but worked for a telephone company for many years and had the chance
          to observe many different leaders. He noticed that the most effective
          and inspiring leaders were those who cared about and served their
          employees, rather than just commanding them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Greenleaf derived the ideas and the name from the book "Journey to
          India" by Hermann Hesse. In this novel, the protagonist encounters a
          group of people led by a “servant”. This image inspired him to develop
          the concept of Servant Leadership. After publishing the essay,
          Greenleaf founded the Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership in 1977.
          The organization is committed to raising awareness of servant
          leadership and helping people and organizations implement this style
          of leadership.
        </p>

          For more in-depth information, you can go directly to the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.greenleaf.org/">Greenleaf Center</a> for Servant
          Leadership website, or read his original essay, "
          <a href="https://www.greenleaf.org/products-page/the-institution-as-servant/">
            The Servant as Leader
          </a>
          ". It is important to note that many of his writings and books are
          still considered important resources in the leadership literature
          today.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            His concept of Servant Leadership remains very different from other
            leadership styles and is used today
          </strong>
          , especially in the agile workspace, to lead self-directed teams.
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Often, Servant Leadership is compared or portrayed primarily with{" "}
          <strong>two leadership styles</strong>:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Authoritarian Leadership:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Here, the boss is the boss, giving orders that employees must
            follow. There is little room for discussion or creativity on the
            part of the employees. They are there to do what they are told. All
            decisions are strictly hierarchical. In contrast, Servant Leadership
            is about supporting employees, encouraging them to contribute their
            ideas and creativity, and promoting their development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transformational Leadership:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            The supervisor here is someone who inspires and motivates, has a
            vision, and gets employees to share and work for that vision. That
            sounds pretty good, right? But the difference with Servant
            Leadership is that in transformational leadership style, the end
            goal is often the boss's vision. Servant Leadership, on the other
            hand, focuses on the well-being and development of the employees,
            and the assumption is that this will ultimately benefit the company.

        <p>
          <strong>
            In what follows, I will attempt to explain these ten
            characteristics:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Listening:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Servant Leaders are like human sponges when it comes to absorbing
            information. They actively listen to what their employees are saying
            instead of just paying attention to their own voice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Empathy:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Think of empathy as the ability to step into another person's shoes.
            Servant Leaders really try to understand their employees' feelings
            and concerns and show that they care.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Healing:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Healing here does not mean curing someone of a disease. Rather, it
            means creating an atmosphere where people can address their problems
            and find solutions. It is about creating a supportive environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-Awareness:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Servant leaders have a mirror into which they look and see
            themselves - metaphorically speaking. They understand their{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/swot-analysis">
              strengths and weaknesses
            </a>{" "}
            and how their behavior affects others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Persuasion:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Instead of directing people with the metaphorical hammer of
            authority, Servant Leaders use gentle persuasion. They build
            consensus and encourage others to commit to a cause of their own
            free will.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Foresight:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Servant leaders possess a crystal ball that allows them to see into
            the future - but only figuratively. They can see patterns and assess
            the possible consequences of decisions before they make them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stewardship:</strong>&nbsp;
            <br />
            Stewardship means that servant leaders act like janitors who look
            after a building. Except that in this case, the building is the
            company or team. They take their responsibilities seriously and make
            sure everything is running well and developing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commitment to the Growth of People:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Servant Leaders are like gardeners who help plants grow. Only here,
            the plants are people. They care about their people growing and
            developing, both professionally and personally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Building Community:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            They are like the captain of a ship, making sure everyone on board
            works together and supports each other. They encourage teamwork and
            make everyone feel part of a community.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community Awareness:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />A Servant Leader thinks not only about his own team or
            company, but also about the community outside. He asks himself how
            decisions might affect society as a whole and works for the good of
            all.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These ten characteristics{" "}
          <strong>
            help a servant leader create a supportive and productive environment
          </strong>{" "}
          in which employees can thrive. However, it is important to note that
          not every leader needs to possess all of these characteristics in
          equal measure to be effective. Rather, it's about finding a balance
          and developing a leadership style that{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/situational-leadership">
            fits the individual and situation

            How Can Servant Leadership Improve Organizational Performance?
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Implementing Servant Leadership as a consulting approach in a company
          can be a powerful way to improve the company's culture and
          performance. It is basically about creating an environment where the
          needs of employees are brought to the forefront and their development
          is encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Here are some steps that might help introduce the Servant Leadership
            approach:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Create Awareness:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            It is important that everyone in the organization, especially senior
            managers, understand the concept of servant leadership and recognize
            its value. This can be achieved through workshops, seminars or
            individual coaching.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Leaders as Role Models:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Leaders play a critical role in the transition to Servant
            Leadership. They should model the principles of Servant Leadership,
            such as active listening, showing empathy, and encouraging employee
            growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solicit Employee Feedback:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            to truly understand employee needs, a feedback system should be
            established that allows employees to express their thoughts, ideas
            and concerns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create an Environment for Growth:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            This can be achieved through continuous learning and development
            programs, mentoring, and providing resources to help employees grow
            their skills and knowledge.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The Benefits of Servant Leadership can be many in such an
            Implementation:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Employee Satisfaction:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            When employees feel their needs are considered and valued, it often
            leads to higher satisfaction and motivation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Team Cohesion:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Servant Leadership can lead to stronger team dynamics and
            collaboration because it focuses on community and mutual support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Innovation:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Because servant leadership encourages employee development and
            growth, it can create an environment that fosters innovation and
            creativity.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>
            However, there are also potential drawbacks or challenges that need
            to be considered:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Time Required:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Implementing servant leadership can take time and requires real
            culture change, which is not always easy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Misconceptions:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            Some people may misinterpret Servant Leadership and see it as a
            weakness, which could lead to a lack of respect.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finding Balance:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            It can be challenging to find the balance between serving and
            leading, especially in situations where quick decisions are
            required.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is important to consider these issues and take a prudent approach
          when implementing Servant Leadership in an organization.

            a leadership style

          can make sense in a variety of contexts in an organization. Here are
          some situations where the introduction of Servant Leadership could be
          particularly useful:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Culture Change:&nbsp;</strong>

              a culture change
            </a>{" "}
            - for example, toward greater employee-centricity, collaboration, or
            innovation - servant leadership can be an effective approach. It can
            help create a culture of care and respect that promotes these
            values.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improve Employee Engagement:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            If a company is having problems with employee motivation or
            engagement, Servant Leadership can be a solution. By focusing on
            employee needs and development, it can lead to higher satisfaction
            and engagement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Strengthen Teamwork:&nbsp;</strong>

              teamwork and collaboration

            are critical, Servant Leadership can help foster a stronger sense of
            community and more effective collaboration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solve Leadership Problems:&nbsp;</strong>
            <br />
            When there are leadership problems in an organization - such as a
            lack of leadership quality or a leadership culture based on control
            and authority - Servant Leadership can make a positive difference.
            It can help create a leadership culture based on employee support
            and development.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, it is important to note that implementing Servant Leadership
          requires significant culture change and cannot happen overnight. It
          requires commitment, patience and continuity to embed this type of
