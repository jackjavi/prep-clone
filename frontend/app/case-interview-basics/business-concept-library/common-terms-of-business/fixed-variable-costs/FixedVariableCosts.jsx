        <p>
          You should be aware by now of the&nbsp;
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/profitability-case">
            profitability&nbsp;framework
          </a>{" "}
          in which we calculate&nbsp;
          <strong>profits by subtracting costs from the revenues</strong> of the
          business.<strong> </strong>In order to understand&nbsp;the underlying
          cost structure, it is important to&nbsp;
          <strong>segment or break down the costs. </strong>In most cases, costs
          can be broken down into&nbsp;<strong>fixed and variable</strong> costs
          because these components differ in&nbsp;
          <strong>two major dimensions</strong>: business activity
          independent&nbsp;and time-dependent.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>1) Business activity independent:</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Fixed costs</strong>&nbsp;are the costs that occur on a
          regular basis including rent, administrative costs, depreciation, and
          salaries, and are independent of the level of activity (e.g.,
          production). On the other hand, <strong>variable costs </strong>are
          directly<strong> connected to the activity&nbsp;</strong>such as raw
          materials, energy, temporary labor costs, or leased employees needed
          to manufacture a product. The schematic below shows roughly how the
          total costs increase with the number of units (or product quantity).
          &nbsp;This information is often useful to "

          <img
            src="http://www.preplounge.com/uploads/bootcamp/images/Fixed%20and%20Variable%20Costs.png"
            alt="The price of the fixed cost does not change with the amount of units. They are always the same. The variable costs depend on the units produced. If no units are produced, the variable costs are zero. Both fixed cost and variable cost add up to the total cost."
          />
        </figure>
        <h4>
          <strong>2) Time-wise adaptability</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Variable costs </strong>can vary and are dependent on time,
          since they are directly related to the manufacturing of the products.
          Note that, if you extend your time frame, all costs including fixed
          costs become variable in theory. Why? Because you can find "better
          deals",&nbsp;high rent <i>vs</i>. low rent or high salaries <i>vs</i>.
          low salaries.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            High/low fixed, and variable costs usually have different
            implications
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          High fixed cost businesses are highly dependent on high volume sales
          to make profits (e.g., airline industry). For example, if you have an
          airline with high fixed costs and low{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/supply-and-demand">
            consumer&nbsp;demand
          </a>
          , you will likely suffer losses. On the other hand,&nbsp;low fixed
          costs&nbsp;come with a low risk of volatile consumer demand, but also
          come with limited{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/growth-strategy">
            growth opportunities
          </a>{" "}
          and a risk of significant cost increases with a sudden increase in
          demand. Additionally, lower fixed costs are an incentive for
          competitors to{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/market-entry">
            enter the market
          </a>{" "}
          more easily (low barriers to entry). Thus, keeping these consequences
          in mind is important while solving a case that involves businesses
          with extremely high/low fixed/variable costs.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            The concept of fixed and variable costs can be deployed in various
            case settings
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          In a <a href="/articles/case-interview">case interview</a> scenario,
          assume your client in the case would like to build a&nbsp;
          <strong>new production facility</strong>&nbsp;that has&nbsp;
          <strong>high fixed costs </strong>and therefore&nbsp;needs a{" "}
          <strong>high utilization</strong>&nbsp;in order to be profitable.
          Knowing that the&nbsp;
          <strong>utilization is primarily driven by demand,&nbsp;</strong>you
          are asked to figure out if this is a good idea.&nbsp;You can analyze
          the case as discussed in&nbsp;the following section.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Logically, you know that if a&nbsp;<strong>competitor</strong>
          &nbsp;also builds a&nbsp;<strong>new plant</strong>, the demand for
          your client's products will decrease.&nbsp;Therefore, given the facts,
          you will need to structure and then&nbsp;
          <strong>analyze the market, </strong>the{" "}
          <strong>competitors,&nbsp;</strong>and the
          <strong> cost structure</strong>&nbsp;using the concept of fixed and
          variable costs. In a case interview,&nbsp;business situations that
          could include such considerations are cases related to&nbsp;Pricing,
          Market Entry or, Growth Strategy.
