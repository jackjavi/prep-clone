        <p>
          The income statement or profit and loss statement (P&amp;L) is a
          summary of the annual revenues, costs, and profits/loss, and is{" "}
          <strong>one of the three financial indicators</strong> in addition
          to&nbsp;

            cash flow statement
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          As opposed to the cash flow statement, the income statement registers
          income and expenses at the accrual date. For instance, when a company
          receives a bill, it shows up in the company's income statement the
          same day when the bill is incurred. Note that in a&nbsp;cash flow
          statement,&nbsp;the cost is not accounted for as cash outflow until
          the bill is actually paid.

            The following are some common terms found in an income statement

        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Operating revenue</strong> relates to all revenue generated
            as part of the regular business of a firm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operating costs</strong>&nbsp;are subdivided into&nbsp;
            <i>COGS (costs of goods sold)</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <i>SGA (selling, general and administrative costs).</i>&nbsp;COGS
            are directly caused by producing goods, such as material costs or
            the amount of labor used. SGA refers to costs that cannot be easily
            attributed to a single product, such as general brand advertisement.
            This cost differentiation is analogous to{" "}

            <strong>Non-operating revenue and cost</strong> are
            non-business-related incomes and expenses, such as revenue from
            selling real estate or costs of a lawsuit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Depreciation</strong> refers to the loss of value of assets,
            for example, used machines that become outdated over time.

          The income statement is a great tool to determine the&nbsp;

            profitability
          </a>{" "}
          of a firm. Looking at financial ratios, the variety of possible
          profitability measures allow deeper analysis and comparison of firms
          (see{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/benchmarking">

          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          The&nbsp;<strong>gross profit margin</strong>&nbsp;provides the
          profitability of the pure core business, taking into account only
          operating revenue, COGS, and SGA.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          For&nbsp;<strong>operating margins</strong>, non-operating costs and
          revenues are taken into account. Also, depreciation can be included as
          it is&nbsp;closely linked to a firm's business, especially in
          asset-heavy industries.
        </p>

          The <strong>net profit margin</strong>&nbsp;considers all costs, also
          interest, and taxes.

        <p>
          If net profit margins are different, but operating margins are the
          same, you can infer that the variance is not directly caused by the
          core business, but rather due to differences in tax and interest
          payments. If you compare profit and loss statements from{" "}
          <strong>consecutive years</strong>, you will&nbsp;
          <strong>identify suspicious trends</strong>, which can be useful for
