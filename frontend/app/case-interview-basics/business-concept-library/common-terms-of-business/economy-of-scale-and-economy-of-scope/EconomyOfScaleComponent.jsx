        <p>
          Economies of scale are cost advantages of a company due to its large
          size. Most companies and businesses can realize advantages of scale
          that are a result of two effects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/fixed-variable-costs">
              Fixed costs
            </a>
            &nbsp;- spread across a large volume of units, decreasing the cost
            per unit
          </li>
          <li>
            Variable costs&nbsp;- low due to operational efficiencies and
            synergies
            <ul>
              <li>
                Larger production processes can be split into smaller,
                repetitive, and simpler tasks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Larger sizes of raw materials and production technologies,
                resulting in bulk discounts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Risks are distributed on a larger scale, leading to fewer demand
                peaks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cheap automatized production technologies become feasible.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Example</strong>:
        </p>
        <p>
          A power supplier has high initial costs for setting up the
          infrastructure. Once the infrastructure is set up, the additional
          costs of providing their service to an additional household are very
          little.&nbsp;Fixed costs will be split into more households and sudden
          demand drops have less impact because other households still
          require&nbsp;sufficient energy levels.

        Economy of Scope: &nbsp;cost advantages because of similar processes of
        different products
        <p>
          Economies of scope are conceptually similar to economies of scale.
          While economies of scale for a firm primarily refer&nbsp;to the
          reduction in the average cost per unit, economies of scope refer to
          lowering the average cost for a firm in producing two or more products
          that could share resources. These two effects lead to economies of
          scope:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Bundling effect</strong>: a single process serves the
            production of different products at the same time. Costs are
            distributed onto a larger product base.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Clustering:</strong>&nbsp;because of proximity, infrastructure
          (as an example) can be used by different companies without additional
          costs.
