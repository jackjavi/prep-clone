            Three Categories:

          <strong>1. Why management consulting?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The majority of the time, candidates would include common answers such
          as opportunities of working in different industries with interesting
          people, solving challenging problems, and traveling.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          When the interviewer asks why they want to work in different
          industries, with interesting people, on different topics, travel, and
          work on challenging problems, the answer is nearly
          always:&nbsp;self-development.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a consultant, you would put the&nbsp;answer first, then explain the
          rationale behind your answer (this communication style is also called{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/pyramid-principle">
            pyramid principle
          </a>
          ):
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, if you are interested in honing your skills and talents
          for self-development, you need to think deeply about how you could
          achieve these goals. Usually, four major areas can lead to your
          self-development in management consulting:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Industries (whether it is trying out a variety of industries or a
            specific industry based on the firm's&nbsp;expertise)
          </li>
          <li>Topics</li>
          <li>Cultures</li>
          <li>People</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Make sure to explain how management consulting will help you achieve
          the above goals through personal stories. An example schematic is
          shown below. &nbsp;
        </p>

        <h3>
          <strong>2. Why [Name of company]?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          You will most likely get asked why you want to work for the company
          during the interview. Apart from slight differences, the bigger
          companies (e.g., McKinsey, BCG, and Bain) are very similar in their
          work, and it is usually&nbsp;their culture that is&nbsp;the
          differentiating factor. Therefore, it is crucial to talk about the
          unique culture of the company and how its values align well with your
          personality.&nbsp;Think of experiences that will convince the firm of
          your personality and its alignment with the firm's culture.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img

          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          In addition to culture, you can talk about your long-term goals and
          how the company is going to help you achieve them. Most people don’t
          stay in consulting in the long run, and it is important to know the
          general direction of your career and the role of consulting to help
          achieve these goals.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <figure class="image">

        <h3>
          <strong>3. Tell me about yourself!&nbsp;</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is another very common question, and it is important that you
          don't read out your CV here. The interviewer has seen your CV and if
          he/she has further questions, you can always back them up with more
          details.&nbsp;The key to answering this question is to provide an
          answer that leaves a&nbsp;<strong>vivid impression</strong>&nbsp;about
          you and ideally gets the interviewer really interested to learn more
          about you. Here, you have a chance to shine and talk about interesting
          things regarding your personality that ultimately are linked to
          consulting. Ideally, the interviewer would want to know more not only
          to evaluate you but also because he/she finds you enthusiastic!
        </p>
        <p>
          One approach is to pick 2-3 things that are really important for you
          and that show well how you think and approach situations, perhaps
          your&nbsp;<strong>CV-Highlights</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another approach is to describe&nbsp;
          <strong>“the person behind the CV”</strong>&nbsp;using&nbsp;
          <strong>three</strong>&nbsp;
          <strong>adjectives (could be 3 key strengths)</strong>&nbsp;that
          really define you and that you can back up with anecdotes and examples
          (See our example exhibit).
        </p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img

          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          So, those are the three most probable fit questions you would get
          during your consulting interview. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Most companies are interested in learning about your past actions in
          scenarios such as working in teams, resolving conflicts, challenges,
          and other scenarios that reflect on your problem-solving skills in a
          "client-friendly" manner. &nbsp;

        <h3>
          <strong>Key takeaways</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure to know the company really well including their culture
            through networking with consultants who work with the company and
            researching the company through their career page
          </li>
          <li>
            Know how to talk about yourself by providing a brief and interesting
            introduction of who you are, either by the “3 Milestones approach”
            or with the “3 adjectives” described&nbsp;above
