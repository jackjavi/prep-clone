            Fit interviews

            case interview
          </a>
          . Although the fit portion generally only&nbsp;requires 10-15 minutes
          during the real interview process, it requires deep thinking from the
          interviewee's perspective and therefore needs meticulous preparation.
          The schematic below shows the flow of the consulting interview
          process.&nbsp;

          To be successful during the interview, you have to understand the
          thinking and the evaluation process of the interviewer.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            Typically, the interviewer has three primary questions in mind
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          1. Would the interviewer like to work with you 12 hours a day on a
          project - <strong>sympathy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Would you be able to support the team and make the work easier for
          the team - <strong>leverage</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Would you be happy with the decision to get into consulting in the
          long run - <strong>happiness</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You are more likely to get an offer when the interviewer is confident
          about you encompassing the above three key qualities. Thus, remember
          to communicate these qualities to the interviewer with your personal
          fit stories!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us understand the preparation process for these categories of
          questions:
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>
            1. Would the interviewer like to work with you 12 hours a day on a
            project?
          </strong>
          &nbsp;
        </h4>
        <p>
          It is challenging to prepare for this part because this component
          serves as a function to display your character and mannerisms.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Just be aware of it and present the best of you&nbsp;at the
          interview&nbsp;without trying to change who you really are and try to
          find a&nbsp;good balance&nbsp;(eg. being self-confident but not
          arrogant).
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>
            2. Would you be able to support the team and make the work easier
            for the team?
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          The underlying question is whether you would be a helpful addition to
          the project team by integrating well with the team and by being
          self-reliant after a short period of time.
        </p>
        <p>So, how does the interviewer check this aspect?</p>
        <p>The interviewer generally has two ways:</p>
        <p>
          1. By doing a case interview with you in order to determine how you
          think and approach a complex problem (please see the{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox">
            Case Cracking Dimension
          </a>
          )
        </p>
        <p>
          2. By asking you fit questions that assess whether you have a wide
          variety of skills necessary to be a successful management
          consultant&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Specifically, what are the most important skills?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Four skills </strong>or personality traits&nbsp;are
          indispensable, which must be demonstrated during the interview:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Flexible - being able to easily cope with changes</li>
          <li>
            Problem solver - being able to break down a complex problem into its
            component parts
          </li>
          <li>
            Diversified team player - being able to work with diverse
            personality types
          </li>
          <li>Hard worker - being willing to go an extra mile</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>
          <strong>
            3. Would you be happy with the decision to get into consulting in
            the long run?
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          The company you would start working for will be investing a lot of
          time and money in your training. If the firm senses that you don’t
          like to travel, have an intense work lifestyle, have the service
          business attitude, or that you might quit after a few months on the
          job, it would not make sense for the company to hire you. Therefore,
          the fit questions would try to probe your personality and determine if
          consulting indeed is the right fit for your personality.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            The fit portion of the interview must also be delivered in a
            structured fashion
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Just as a case interview, the fit interview must also be developed in
          a <strong>structured</strong>&nbsp;fashion.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of the fit interview as a case study. If you can’t afford to be
          unstructured during a case, then why should you be unstructured while
          talking about the most important experiences of your life or the
          rationale behind your decisions? Therefore, the objective is to be
          structured when answering&nbsp;Personal Fit&nbsp;questions.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this approach will demonstrate that you already possess the
          skills needed to be successful as a management consultant.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Key takeaways:</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The fit interview is <strong>underestimated</strong> by the majority
          of the candidates, but it is <strong>a crucial component </strong>to
          receive&nbsp;an offer
        </p>
        <p>
          You must spend<strong>&nbsp;time to prepare your fit stories</strong>
          &nbsp;and know what you want to say in a structured fashion
        </p>
        <p>
          The interviewer is interested in learning about
          <strong> three things </strong>about your personality:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Would the interviewer like to work with you for long hours on a
            project - <strong>sympathy</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Would you be able to support the team and make their work easier
            -&nbsp;<strong>leverage</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Would you be happy with the decision to get into consulting in the
            long run -&nbsp;<strong>happiness</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Be structured and provide well-thought-out answers</li>
