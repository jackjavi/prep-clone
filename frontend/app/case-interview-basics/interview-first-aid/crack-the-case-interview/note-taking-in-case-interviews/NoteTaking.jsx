            Note-taking Is Key to Setting Up a Good Structure for Your Case:
            Practice the Skill
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The structure is a very important part of the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/articles/case-interview">
            case interview
          </a>
          . In fact, in most cases when candidates do not get a pass in their
          interview, it is because of their inability to structure the problem.
          Ideally, you should{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type">
            structure your case
          </a>{" "}
          based on two categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Incoming information </strong>which you receive and process
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Outgoing information </strong>which you communicate to your
            case partner
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To show your interviewer how you structure, you need to display how
          you receive and process information mentally and how you would express
          your thoughts to a potential client. Taking good notes helps in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understanding the structure</li>
          <li>Remembering the structure</li>
          <li>Referring to the structure when required</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            Your interviewer will usually not give you all the information that
            is necessary to solve the case
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          To be able to spot missing data and be organized, use the following
          approach:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gather information</li>
          <li>Organize information and make conclusions</li>
          <li>Support conclusions with data analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For all three tasks, use a different sheet of paper and
          never&nbsp;write on the back of these sheets. During stressful
          situations such as a case interview, you run into&nbsp;a high risk
          of&nbsp;losing track&nbsp;of where the information is if you cannot
          see everything on one side of the sheets. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The following examples show how the system applies in practice while
          taking notes:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Gather information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You gather information and take notes only at the beginning&nbsp;of
          the case. Make sure you donâ€™t miss any details, especially if the
          interviewer is providing you with numerical data.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Organize information and make conclusions&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This&nbsp;step is <strong>extremely&nbsp;crucial &nbsp;</strong>
          (organizing&nbsp;initial information and interpreting it). Here, you
          would want to build a&nbsp;<strong>framework</strong>&nbsp;for your
          approach and structure your hypotheses using an&nbsp;
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/issue-tree">
            issue tree
          </a>
          .&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Start testing your hypotheses based on your structure and adapt it
          according to your results (whether the hypothesis is true or not). Use
          this particular sheet as a guide whenever you run into dead ends and
          to keep you structured. This approach will help you in clarifying your
          approach to the interviewer and yourself at every step of the analysis
          because it forces you to regularly make sub-conclusions and recaps.
          Use <strong>landscape format </strong>and as much graphic support as
          possible. This manner would also demonstrate to the interviewer that
          you think like a consultant.&nbsp;
