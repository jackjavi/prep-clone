          is a&nbsp;30-minute&nbsp;simulation of a typical business project that
          consultants may have worked on. Cases&nbsp;provide a real example of
          an on-job experience and the assumption is that if a candidate is
          successfully able to tackle a case interview, they are more likely to
          be a successful management consultant. Unfortunately, several
          outstanding candidates with top grades and co-curriculars fail case
          interviews in the recruiting process.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is that? One reason is that several candidates memorize standard{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts">
            frameworks,
          </a>
          &nbsp;hoping to recall each framework during case interviews.
          Frameworks, though useful for a rudimentary layout of case problems,
          must be tweaked and customized for{" "}

            different cases

          .
        </p>
        <p>
          While good candidates use standard frameworks to systematically solve
          the problems in consulting case interviews, outstanding candidates
          also see the big picture and adapt the frameworks specific to the
          business case. To become an outstanding candidate:

          These case studies are the main and usually the longest part of
          consulting interviews. During the 20 to 40-minute case interview, you
          will be confronted with a&nbsp;<strong>business problem</strong>
          &nbsp;that is often drawn from one of the interviewer’s real-life
          engagements. Below is a schematic showing a typical process for a
          consulting interview after a resume screening.&nbsp;

          Many companies&nbsp;peer-review and standardize their consulting
          business cases prior to a real case interview to ensure that the case
          is neither too hard nor too easy. The companies also ensure to test a
          variety of&nbsp;skills&nbsp;during case interviews.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the case books you may know from your university or case
          reports in business journals, the&nbsp;
          <strong>initial information</strong>&nbsp;you will get is&nbsp;
          <strong>very limited.</strong>&nbsp;You won’t be able to solve the
          case using only this initial information, also known as the opening of
          the case.&nbsp;Typical openings are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            “
            <i>
              Company ABC&nbsp;is a watch manufacturer who is recently
              experiencing profit problems and a decline in market share, what
              should they do?
            </i>
            ”
          </li>
          <li>
            “
            <i>
              Company XY&nbsp;is an automotive company who is thinking about
              entering the Chinese market in 2014, should they go east?

            ”
          </li>
          <li>
            “
            <i>
              Company Z is a private equity company that contemplates merging

            ”
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After the opening of a case, you should take a couple of minutes to
          structure your thoughts and come up with a customized framework (more
          on this later).&nbsp;
