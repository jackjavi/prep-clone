          <strong>
            Candidate-led Case Interviews: The Key Challenge is Structuring The
            Problem
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          As the title suggests, in candidate-led cases, the interviewer expects
          the candidate&nbsp;to ‘<i>lead’ </i>her/him through the case. As the
          candidate, it is your responsibility to lead the case by asking
          relevant questions and also to develop and test your hypotheses.{" "}
          <strong>Candidate-led cases are the most common</strong>{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type">
            types of cases
          </a>
          . You’ll encounter them at the majority of the{" "}
          <a href="/en/articles/differences-between-big-4">
            big consulting firms
          </a>{" "}
          such as BCG, Bain, and occasionally at McKinsey.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            A candidate-led case usually has the following characteristics:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A very broad description of a situation</li>
          <li>A very general question or no question at all</li>
          <li>
            The interviewer gives you complete freedom in terms of the approach
            and the structure
          </li>
          <li>Data and information is mostly provided at your request</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>
            As opposed to interviewer-led cases, it is harder for the
            interviewer to test specific abilities as the candidate defines what
            he wants to investigate or talk about
          </strong>
          . On the other hand, you as the candidate need to be strong in
          defining and testing hypotheses. You need a clear roadmap in mind that
          allows you to ask targeted questions as opposed to randomly
          ‘bombarding’ your interviewer with random questions hoping for a lucky
          punch.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            Be thorough and exceptionally structured. Here are some aspects to
            consider in a candidate-led case format:
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Based on the information you get through your questions,{" "}
            <strong>
              set up a hypothesis that you test with further questions
            </strong>
            . Remember to also share your hypothesis with your interviewer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be thorough in your investigation. Don’t just scratch the surface
            and give some ideas, but dig deep into your hypothesis to uncover if
            there is a possible solution.{" "}
            <strong>
              The interviewer would not want to guide you towards the solution
            </strong>
            . He/She would probably give small and subtle hints to see how you
            react. For this to work, your questions have to be very specific.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be exceptionally structured in a&nbsp;candidate-led case.{" "}
            <strong>You need to be able to keep track of your data</strong>.
            Interviewers will be interested in the synthesis, i.e.&nbsp;
            <strong>how</strong>&nbsp;you drew your conclusions. Also, new
            information might urge you to take some steps back in your
            argumentation. A good structure and thorough&nbsp;notes&nbsp;are
            key!
          </li>
          <li>
            Be prepared to <strong>answer questions about details</strong> that
            could not be covered due to your choice of the procedure, but that
            are nonetheless important for the interviewer.
          </li>
          <li>
            As soon as it becomes clear what the decisive factor is,{" "}
            <strong>reformulate your hypothesis and test it!</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            Interviewer-led cases: the key challenge is to adapt quickly and
            also be structured
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Interviewer-led cases are most frequently used at McKinsey. As the
          title suggests, the interviewer’s guidance through the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/articles/case-interview">
            case interview
          </a>{" "}
          is firmer.{" "}
          <strong>
            Following are a few indicators that hint towards interviewer-led
            cases:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A very specific case question</li>
          <li>
            Either a lot of data will be given to you along with an initial
            breakdown of sub-problems or a broad problem may be given to you and{" "}
            <strong>
              you would need to structure the problem by being as specific as
              possible
            </strong>
            . After structuring, the interviewer will ask you a set of
            pre-determined questions irrespective of what your structure is
            (this could be an abrupt move, so do not get nervous when this
            happens!)
          </li>
          <li>
            Interviewer-induced interruptions with turnarounds not resulting
            from the candidate’s analysis
          </li>
          <li>Lots of given data throughout the case, e.g. tables or graphs</li>
          <li>“What else” types of questions</li>
          <li>“Please explain more in detail” types of questions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          McKinsey-style case interviews give the interviewer a more direct
          opportunity to test specific skills that the interviewer is interested
          in learning about you and assess areas of weaknesses.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            Remain in the driver's seat and beware of curveball questions
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Despite the name of this case class, the candidate still needs to be
          the active leader of the overall case interview. Especially in
          interviewer-led cases, the largest fallacy is to become passive,
          unstructured, and driven by the interviewer.{" "}
          <strong>
            To lead the case, you need to be particularly structured
          </strong>
          . Be prepared for interruptions, and anticipate that they might
          disprove hypotheses or force you to develop a completely new
          framework.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep the big picture in mind. If the interviewer implicitly gives
            you a hypothesis he/she wants you to test, keep in mind other
            sources of problems or possible solutions. You might need them
            later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive (
            <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/mece-principle">
              MECE
            </a>
            ). It will help you to
            <strong>
              {" "}
              be prepared and structurally evaluate further on “what else” and
              “explain more in detail” types of questions.
            </strong>{" "}
            If you rank your answers into a MECE framework, you avoid a random
            and unstructured collection of ideas. The biggest difference
            compared to candidate-led cases is that you usually have to come up
            with an exhaustive list of hypotheses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Beware of curveball questions and stress tests.
            <strong>
              {" "}
              Interviewer-led cases are sometimes used to assess if a candidate
              can handle pressure
            </strong>
            . The interviewer might deliberately cut your time to calculate
            things, show that she/he is impatient, or unexpectedly change the
            direction of the case. The best approach here is to keep calm and
            adapt as the situation demands.
          </li>

          <strong>Key takeaways</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Candidate-led cases are about your ability to ‘crack’ a broad
            problem
          </li>
          <li>
            Interviewer-led or McKinsey-style interviews are about being able to
            analyze the MECE way. You will most likely encounter a stressful
            moment. Always pause and think in a structured fashion
