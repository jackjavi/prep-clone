          This approach will allow you to crack any type of case study. Solving
          a case in a
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/articles/case-interview">
            case interview
          </a>{" "}
          is not very different from the approach a consultant uses in real life
          to solve clients' problems. You will need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Develop an exhaustive structure that will guide you throughout the
            case interview efficiently. The structure ideally will tell you
            where to look for the solution to the problem
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop a hypothesis early on and prioritize the information you
            need to gather. Apply the 80/20 rule to figure out which answer to
            what question will have the biggest impact on the&nbsp;case solution
            (80/20 rule or
            <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/pareto-principle">
              Pareto Principle
            </a>
            );
          </li>
          <li>
            Gather data and know why you need the information and what
            conclusions can you draw which would ultimately help you get to the
            solution
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In a case interview, your only source for data is the Interviewer.
          Hence, it is important that you establish open
          <strong> bi-directional communication</strong> and obviously, your
          rapport with the interviewer is very important.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure you ask for only relevant information and ideally let the
          interviewer know why you need a particular piece of data, be as open
          and transparent in your thought process as possible, and think out
          loud to let the interviewer know your thinking process including your
          current hypothesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Interviewer will likely provide verbal information or charts based
          on your questions.&nbsp;

          <strong>How to Approach a Case Study in 4 Steps:</strong>
        </h3>

          <br />
          The foundation for a successful case is set at the beginning so follow
          these steps religiously during your interview practice:
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>
            1. Restate the question and make sure you understand the problem
            statement by confirming with the interviewer
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Understand the problem really well before structuring or asking for
          data. Do not simply repeat the question but rephrase it in such a way
          that it would avoid misunderstandings. This is important because in
          consulting, it is crucial to understand the needs of the customers.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>2. Clarify the goals</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ask specific questions to clarify goals. “So our objective is to
          increase the bottom line. Are there any other objectives I should know
          of?” If there is more than one objective, do not try to solve them all
          at once, instead, break the problem into pieces and solve one piece at
          a time. This will allow you to stay focused.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>3. Write out your structure</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          First,&nbsp;<strong>ask your interviewer for a minute</strong>&nbsp;to
          prepare your structure since this part is extremely important and
          determines whether you will succeed in solving the case.{" "}
          <strong>Don’t be afraid of the silence!</strong>&nbsp;Practice{" "}

          ), you do not have to worry about running into dead ends because even
          if you do, you can dig down an alternative branch that will ultimately

          <strong>
            4. Ask questions to understand the trends of the&nbsp;client,
            industry, and product
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ask questions about the firm’s business model, the state of the
          competition and its substitutes, the firm’s position within the
          industry, and the product. Make sure to ask about changes (or deltas)
          [how/if things have changed]. Example categories
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is the current situation of the client</li>
          <li>What has changed&nbsp;from previous years</li>
          <li>
            What are the financial (&amp; non-financial) predictions given the
            current situation

        </ul>
        <h4>
          <strong>Client:</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the business model. Even if you
          have graduated with a business degree, it is impossible to know a
          company's business model without investigating details. Thus, solving
          a case based on false assumptions is worse than asking a question you
          think you should know beforehand. Typically, you'd want to know:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The size of the company</li>
          <li>Whether it is profitable and growing</li>
          <li>How a business transaction works within the company</li>
          <li>
            How is the product being produced and what are some crucial
            production steps?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          <strong>Industry:</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          For cases where external factors are decisive (e.g.&nbsp;

          <li>At which point of the lifecycle is the industry?</li>

            Case Interview Structure - Your Key Ability to Ace the Case Study
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          A key evaluation criterion is your ability to structure a case and
          being able to adapt the structure throughout the case. A good case
          structure is the most important part of the case. Based on your
          structure, you will need to interpret the new information and draw
          conclusions from it. Try to segment your information&nbsp;until you
          have isolated the problem.&nbsp;If the problem is not captured by your
          structure, you will likely not be able to solve the case. Remember to
          practice setting up a case structure&nbsp; during your interview
          preparation.

        <p>
          Make sure you focus on data that is relevant and important to answer
          the case problem.&nbsp;This will demonstrate to your interviewer that
          you don’t blindly note down everything. Thus, before analyzing
          anything, it would make sense to paraphrase in your head and write
          only relevant information. Make sure to take notes in a structured
          fashion.&nbsp;This will ensure that you will remember the relevant
          case information and have quick access to it even during a stressful
          interview.&nbsp;To summarize, before noting down and sharing the
          information with the interviewer,&nbsp;analyze it and determine its

                assumptions
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Organize your notes (consultants are supposed to always be
            “client-ready”)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>List hypotheses</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Always list a few possible hypotheses and set out with one of them
            (e.g.{" "}
            <i>
              "Since you have mentioned that revenues are more or less flat, my
              hypothesis is that the problem is mostly driven by the cost side
              of the business. If it is ok with you I will start by analyzing
              this side of the Profit tree first.
            </i>
            ")
          </li>
          <li>Start with the corresponding branch of the framework</li>
          <li>Refine/rebuild hypothesis as you find out more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Think &amp; Gather</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Think out loud</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The interviewer is interested but has no crystal ball. You have to
            tell him what you are thinking
          </li>
          <li>
            Sharing your thoughts allows the interviewer to interact. He will
            give you hints such as nodding if you are on the right track
          </li>
          <li>
            If you ever get stuck, the interviewer is in a better position to
            help you out since he knows where you are in your thought process
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <div class="highlight-box highlight-box-light-grey js-highlight-box">
          Thinking aloud is client-friendly!
        </div>
        <p>Gather data the right way</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ALWAYS&nbsp;segment your data (e.g. using the ABC analysis)</li>
          <li>Proactively ask for relevant data</li>
          <li>
            Don’t be too vague in your questions. ("
            <i>Why are profits declining</i>" is a bad question. "
            <i>
              So, profits have been declining. Does the client have any data
              about recent changes in either the revenues or the cost position
              of the company?
            </i>
            " is better)
            <ul>
              <li>
                Quantify whenever possible ("
                <i>By how much have revenues been declining?</i>")
              </li>
              <li>
                Go for various trend data (this year vs. last years OR client
                vs. competition)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to evaluate whether trends have been company-specific or
            industry-wide
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Structure &amp; Close</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Stay structured throughout the case</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Always refer to the structure you have set up at the beginning of
            the case
            <ul>
              <li>
                Remember: be flexible with your structure as the case evolves
              </li>
              <li>
                Don’t jump around framework branches without finishing analyzing
                a branch, always solve problems serially
              </li>
              <li>
                Explore branches of your issue tree and eliminate them when you
                reach a dead-end
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Summarize findings when switching major branches. This can also be
            done during the case
          </li>
          <li>Be&nbsp;MECE!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Close the case properly</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ask for 30 secs to a minute to gather your thoughts (try to draw
            them)
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose a recommendation and stand by it!
            <ul>
              <li>
                For consulting projects, it is important to have a clear
                recommendation
              </li>
              <li>Your recommendation must be action-oriented</li>
              <li>
                Your interviewer will likely challenge your recommendation
                (either to see if you can handle pressure or to assess if you
                really believe in what you are saying): stand by your
                recommendation (obviously within reasonable limits)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            When communicating your solution, put the most interesting part
            first: <strong>first </strong>conclusion/recommendation{" "}
            <strong>then </strong>justification
            <ul>
              <li>
                Do not go over the analysis in your recommendation and focus on
                the important outcome ("
                <i>Here is what you should do: [...] and this is why: [...]"</i>
                )
              </li>
              <li>People like 3: give the interviewer 3 reasons</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Case Interviews are an
            <strong>&nbsp;important&nbsp;part of candidate assessment</strong>
            &nbsp;where&nbsp;communication, problem-solving ability, business
            judgment, and data interpretation skills are being evaluated
          </li>
          <li>
            They are more standardized and better to prepare for than you might
            think. How to&nbsp;successfully prepare for a case interview depends
            a lot on your willingness to&nbsp;PRACTICE. PrepLounge and most Case
            Interview resources recommend at least 30 case simulations before
            you go to your first real interview
          </li>
          <li>
            You need to get used to a structured approach of problem-solving
            that is similar to how a real-life engagement is approached
