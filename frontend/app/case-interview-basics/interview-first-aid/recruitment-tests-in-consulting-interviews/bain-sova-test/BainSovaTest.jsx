            The Bain Sova Test is an aptitude test for applicants to Bain &amp;
            Company
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          It consists of the{" "}
          <strong>
            4 areas verbal reasoning, numerical reasoning, logical reasoning and
            personality
          </strong>{" "}
          with about 15 questions per area. There is no time limit, but the time
          you need for the test is recorded.

        <p>
          <strong>1. verbal reasoning</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the verbal reasoning section of the Sova Test, you have to solve
          and answer multiple-choice questions. The goal is{" "}
          <strong>
            to decide whether the statement is true or false based on the
            information given in the text
          </strong>
          . Another possibility is that there is no accurate statement.
          Accordingly, you need to be able to analyze complicated written
          information in order to interpret it in the next step.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. numerical reasoning</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After the verbal reasoning part, we continue with numerical reasoning.
          This part aims to <strong>test your mathematical skills</strong>. You
          will have to interpret data presented in graphs and tables. This
          section tests the applicants' ability to work with quantitative data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. logical reasoning</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The third part of the test consists of{" "}
          <strong>
            completing a logical sequence of shapes by recognizing the pattern
            of the sequence
          </strong>
          . This is intended to assess the applicant's ability to deal with
          abstract concepts and unknown information. It also allows the
          interviewer to test your ability to solve complex problems through
          logical reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4. personality</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The last part of the Sova test is the personality test. This is a
          series of statements that{" "}
          <strong>
            tell the interviewer about your behavior and demeanor towards
            colleagues in the workplace
          </strong>
          . Personality traits that are often tested are problem-solving,
          decision-making, motivation, flexibility, communication, etc. There
          are <strong>2 types of personality tests</strong>. One is the{" "}
          <strong>traditional personality test</strong>, where you have to read
          a number of sentences and decide afterward how true or untrue they are
          for you. You are rated with Least Like Me, Little Like Me, Neutral,
          Somewhat Like Me and Most Like Me. On the other hand, there is the{" "}
          <strong>
            personality test, in which you have to evaluate a situation
          </strong>
          . For example, you are shown a video or statement related to your work
          situation, for which you have to rate statements from Last Favorable
          to Most Favorable.
        </p>
