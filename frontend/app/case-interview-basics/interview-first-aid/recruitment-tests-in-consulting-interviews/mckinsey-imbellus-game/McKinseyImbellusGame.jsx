          <strong>
            The McKinsey Imbellus Game (or Imbellus Solve) replaces the PST that
            McKinsey used until recently
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/articles/mckinsey-problem-solving-game">
            McKinsey Imbellus Game
          </a>{" "}
          has proven to be{" "}
          <strong>
            very effective in providing a more holistic assessment of applicants
          </strong>
          . At the same time, it reduces bias against those unfamiliar with
          standardized testing and helps expedite recruitment during
          pandemic-related closures. As of May 2020, this has resulted in 15,000
          McKinsey applicants being tested in more than 30 countries. Those
          numbers have undoubtedly grown exponentially since then as more
          cohorts take the test and McKinsey expands it to the rest of its
          network of firms.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            The Imbellus Game is based on the use of simulations that measure
            candidates' cognitive abilities
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>The McKinsey Imbellus Game typically includes 4 parts:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img

          />
        </figure>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Digital Skills:</strong> This part tests your skills in
            using technology and digital tools. You have to solve tasks like
            sorting files and performing simple programming tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Abstraction:</strong> This part is about recognizing
            abstract patterns and relationships. For example, you identify a
            series of shapes and match them up or solve abstract problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spatial reasoning:</strong> This part tests your ability to
            process and manipulate spatial information. Tasks such as designing
            3D objects or solving spatial problems are included.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Behavioral skills:</strong> This part tests your ability to
            interact with other people and your emotional skills. You have to
            solve tasks like recognizing emotions in facial expressions or
            interpreting social interactions.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In summary, the McKinsey Imbellus Game is a comprehensive test that
          measures applicants' cognitive abilities in various areas. The
          McKinsey digital assessment is played on a desktop, not on a
          smartphone like other games. It looks and{" "}
          <strong>feels like a PC game</strong> and is very intuitive for the
          user.
