            Pymetrics Game Assessment is an online tool for conducting
            psychometric tests and analyzing soft skills that may be important
            for certain careers or positions
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The test is popularly used in{" "}

          .{" "}
          <strong>
            It consists of a series of games and exercises designed to measure
            certain psychological traits and skills, such as cognitive ability,
            emotional intelligence, risk-taking, adaptability, assertiveness and
            more.
          </strong>{" "}
          The Pymetrics platform uses machine learning to analyze your responses
          and performance in games to create a comprehensive assessment of your
          skills and traits. It represents a new way for large companies, such
          as BCG, Bain, and Roland Berger, to evaluate and screen their
          applicants.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            The test is game-based and contains elements to test specific skills
            or traits
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Many large companies have incorporated a game element into their
            application process
          </strong>{" "}
          in recent years. This trend is expected to continue. Pymetrics
          game-based assessment is an unbiased, scalable way for them to reduce
          their candidate pool to a manageable number.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The test consists of two parts:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Assessment Games:</strong> in this part, a series of games
            or exercises are presented, each lasting approximately 2-5 minutes.
            These games are designed to measure behaviors that are relevant to
            specific jobs or positions. For example, one game might aim to
            measure your ability to react quickly to changing circumstances,
            while another measures your ability to complete tasks quickly and
            accurately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Survey Questions:</strong> In this section, you will be
            asked a series of questions aimed at measuring your attitudes and
            preferences. These questions cover a variety of skills, such as your
            ability to work under stress, as well as your motivation and
            attitude toward risk.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The results of the test are then passed on to the employer or HR
            department
          </strong>{" "}
          to help them make a better decision about whether you are suitable for
          the advertised position.

          <strong>
            The games differ in the tasks that candidates have to solve
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Examples of the tasks included are:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You are shown sequences of shapes of different sizes and colors on
            the screen, and you must tap the screen when certain shapes appear
          </li>
          <li>
            You are shown a pattern on the screen, and you have to move the
            available characters so that they represent the pattern in as few
            moves as possible
          </li>
          <li>
            Recognize the emotion of a cartoon character based on his facial
            expression and/or a short sentence from the context
          </li>
          <li>
            Recognize simple irregularities in patterns and tap the screen when
            they appear
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember sequences of shapes and/or numbers after they are shown on
            the screen in sequence
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            The Pymetrics Game can be taken on a smartphone or desktop and is
            similar to many other puzzle apps
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can solve all the games with simple buttons or by tapping the
          screen in time. The Pymetrics Games create the same pressure and
          nervousness as a number sense test because the scenarios are so new, a
          certain amount of math is required, and there is some time pressure.
          They are very intuitive, so you don't have to worry about not
          understanding them or finding your way around the app. As long as you
          have a smartphone and are familiar with downloading and opening an
          app, you can complete the Pymetrics game assessment.

          <strong>A wide variety of personality traits are tested</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Pymetrics Game Assessments create a picture of the applicant based
          on 9 personality traits in 12/16 games:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Risk Tolerance</li>
          <li>Attention</li>
          <li>Effort</li>
          <li>Fairness</li>
          <li>Decision making</li>
          <li>Learning</li>
          <li>Emotions</li>
          <li>Generosity</li>
          <li>Focus</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Many companies only use 12 games in their assessment and therefore
          only test the 9 personality traits.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            Pymetrics also tests your technical skills, among others
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pymetrics offers an additional 4 games to test two technical skills:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Numerical Dexterity</li>
          <li>Quantitative Reasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There is no one-to-one mapping of the games to the individual traits
          tested. The results of several games are used to create the candidate
          profile.
