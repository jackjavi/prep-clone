            BCG Online Case
          </a>{" "}
          <strong>has now been rolled out globally</strong> and has replaced the
          BCG Potential Test in all but a few offices. So if you're applying to
          BCG, you'll probably have to take the new BCG Online Case.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            In the BCG Online Case (also called the Chatbot Interview), a
            chatbot named Casey presents you with a real case, similar to the
            one you might receive from human interviewers
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          However, because it's a chatbot interview, the case is not guided by
          an interviewer, which means you have little to no control over the
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case contains 8 to 10 questions that are asked through an instant
          messenger-like interface and must be solved in 25 to 30 minutes. These
          questions take 2 forms:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Multiple-choice questions</strong> where candidates must
            select what data they need to move forward, what analysis they want
            to do next, or what their findings/conclusions are
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Open-ended questions</strong> where candidates must explain
            their answers to the previous multiple-choice questions or answer a
            math or creative question
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>
            After this procedure, there is a one-page video interview question
            at the end where you are asked to make a recommendation.
          </strong>{" "}
          You have 1 minute to prepare and another minute to present your
          conclusion to the client. Because there are open-ended explainer
          questions, your score is not as easy as other, more traditional
          screening tests like the McKinsey Imbellus and the BCG Potential Test.
          Instead of a standardized score (i.e., how many questions a candidate
          answered correctly), you will likely be evaluated holistically on the
          key consulting competencies mentioned earlier, and your performance
          will be compared to that of other candidates.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You will receive your results within 2 weeks.</strong> In some
          cases, the test is given as part of the first round interviews. Your
          performance in the test will be evaluated together with your
          performance in the{" "}
          <a href="/en/articles/case-interview">case interview</a>. You will
          then be notified of the results accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You only have one chance to pass the new test</strong> - if
          you don't pass, you can't try again for another 1 to 2 years.
          Therefore, it is important that you prepare yourself very well to
          master the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The differences from the BCG Potential Test are as follows:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculators are allowed</li>
          <li>Only 25-30 minutes to solve the case instead of 45 minutes</li>
          <li>8-10 questions instead of 23</li>
          <li>Open-ended questions instead of multiple-choice questions</li>
          <li>It ends with a video summary</li>
        </ul>

          BCG's basic hypothesis in introducing this test is that if you do well
          in these areas, you should also do well in a real case interview and
          in live situations with the client.
        </p>
        <p>You should master the following key skills:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview-exercises/structuring-drills">
              Structured Thinking
            </a>
            : You must be able to break down complex problems into smaller,
            manageable pieces and develop a clear structure for solving the
            problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytical Skills:</strong> You must be able to quickly
            analyze and interpret data to gain insight and make informed
            decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creativity:</strong> you must be able to develop creative
            solutions and find alternative approaches to solve complex problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication:</strong> You must be able to communicate your
            thoughts clearly and concisely, and explain complex concepts in an
            understandable way.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Time Management:</strong> You must be able to plan and
            prioritize effectively to make efficient use of the time available.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Collaboration:</strong> you must be able to work with others
            and foster effective teamwork to develop collaborative solutions.

          If you master these key skills and prepare specifically for the BCG
          Online Case interview, your chances of a successful interview are
          good.
