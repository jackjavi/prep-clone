          Like with any skill, getting proficient at solving cases involves
          different stages, through which one progresses – usually from
          incompetence to competence. We have identified 3 main stages based on
          the testimonials of successful candidates:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Onboarding</strong>&nbsp;(
            <i>&lt;10 cases, conscious incompetence</i>): Candidates overcome
            the “inertia” to start practicing by getting a feel for live{" "}
            <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/articles/case-interview">
              case interviews
            </a>
            . Also, in this stage, candidates recognize their deficits and the
            need for regular practice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ramp-up </strong>(<i>10-30 cases, conscious competence)</i>:
            Candidates start forming good habits of practicing regularly. In
            this stage, candidates know how to go about solving the case but
            require a lot of concentration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Internalization</strong>&nbsp;(
            <i>&gt;30 cases, unconscious competence</i>): Candidates are
            starting to structure cases with customized frameworks (e.g.{" "}
            <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/issue-tree">
              issue tree
            </a>
            )&nbsp;and have time to build rapport with the interviewer. In this
            final stage, candidates can almost solve the case effortlessly and
            therefore go beyond the case.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It’s important to bear in mind that there is no magic number of cases
          that one has to reach. This depends from candidate to candidate and
          can range anywhere from 15 to 100. It’s better to focus on the
          progression through the stages and to keep pushing until the skills
          are internalized. Quitting before this stage or getting stuck in the
          previous stage tends to be the difference between <i>almost </i>
          getting the offer and <i>actually </i>getting the offer.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Take on both interviewee and interviewer roles</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Though it is crucial to get as much practice solving cases (as an
          interviewee), it is also helpful to play the role of an interviewer.
          Aside from it being fair to “give and take” cases, as an interviewer
          you get a different angle. For instance, you will see potential
          mistakes or best practices first-hand – both of which you can learn
          from.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are new to mock interviews with peers, here are a couple of
          guidelines to help you get started as an interviewer:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In general, you should:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Read and solve a{" "}
                <a href="/en/case-sammlung">case from our library</a> for
                yourself before giving it
              </li>
              <li>Note that there may be different solutions to the case</li>
              <li>
                Feel free to help your practice partners if they are stuck
                <br />
                &nbsp;
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Look out for the following during the case:
            <ul>
              <li>Are they asking good questions?</li>
              <li>Are they laying out a logical structure?</li>
              <li>Are they quantifying their approach?</li>
              <li>Are they able to synthesize the case?</li>
              <li>Are they confident, professional, and/or pleasant?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>How do I schedule meetings with peers?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          PrepLounge is a case interview community that connects like-minded
          people for regular practice. There are two quick ways to schedule
          meetings for mock interviews with peers: make a proposal to the{" "}
          <a href="/en/meeting-board">Meeting Board</a> or send a private
          invitation.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Meeting Board Proposal</strong>
            <br />
            On the Meeting Board (at your dashboard), you’ll see lots of
            proposals for back-to-back meetings. Add your own proposal to the
            list and wait for a candidate to confirm the meeting.
            <br />
            &nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personal Invitation</strong>
            <br />
            On the <a href="/en/case-partner">Candidate Listing</a>, you’ll have
            an overview of potential practice partners. Your best match is
            pre-selected (on the filter functions on the left). On the profile
            of a candidate, you can send an invitation with the Propose Meeting
            button.
          </li>
        </ol>

            Optional: Expert coachings to enhance your case interview skills
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you’re looking to take it to the next level, coaches on PrepLounge
          i.e. experienced (former) consultants can help you enhance your case
          prep with more realism and insightful feedback. Here are three ways
          for you to interact with our coaches:

        <p>
          <strong>1. Benefit from the CoachingPlus Package:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The&nbsp;
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/shop/best-value-for-money-coaching-6/coachingplus-5-19">
            CoachingPlus package
          </a>
          &nbsp;offers you a&nbsp;combination of several coaching sessions plus
          a{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/shop/premium-memberships-1/premium-prep-6-months-access-103">
            Premium Membership
          </a>
          &nbsp;that gives you access to the most essential prep material on
          PrepLounge. You can choose among a list of about 15 coaches, so have a
          look and check whether they fulfill the specific needs of your
          application (e.g. target company, location, etc.). They are all
          experienced former management consultants at top firms. The
          CoachingPlus package would be your&nbsp;
          <strong>go-to all-in-one prep package</strong>, especially if you are
          on a lower budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Get Top of the Line Coaching Packages:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of our&nbsp;
          <strong>
            best coaches offer their very own&nbsp;coaching packages
          </strong>
          . This is a great investment, as they have the most experience and
          already helped hundreds of candidates land their dream job offer. The
          only disadvantage is the higher price and that you are tied to&nbsp;
          <strong>one single coach.</strong>&nbsp;However, if you complement
          your coaching sessions with high-quality peer2peer practice, these
          top-of-the-line coaching packages will be your top option.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Book an Individual Coaching Session:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, it makes sense to take advantage of coaching packages, as
          they always come with an overall discount compared to individually
          booked sessions. However, if you are in a&nbsp;
          <strong>very specific situation</strong>&nbsp;and the coach you are
          looking for is not included in a package, it makes sense to arrange
          individual sessions with the&nbsp;coaches of your choice. This also
          offers you a lot of&nbsp;<strong>flexibility</strong>, as you are not
          tied to specific coaches.
