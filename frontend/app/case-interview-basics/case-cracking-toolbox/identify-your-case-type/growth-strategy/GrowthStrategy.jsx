        <p>
          Usually, growth strategy cases are introduced by open-ended questions
          such as “A firm XYZ wants to increase their revenue. How should they
          go about it?”

          <a href="/en/articles/case-interview">Case interviews</a>&nbsp;with
          revenue growth&nbsp;cases can be tackled by influencing two major
          parameters that determine growth figures. These are volume and unit
          price. In order to make suggestions, once again, you need to
          understand the client’s business and the industry. Growth strategies
          can focus on a product, a division, or the company as a whole. Areas
          you could investigate based on your hypothesis are:
