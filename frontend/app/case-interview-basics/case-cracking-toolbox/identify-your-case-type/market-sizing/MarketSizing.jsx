          <strong>
            Market Sizing Questions in Consulting Interviews – The Three Golden
            Rules
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Market sizing questions</strong> (sometimes known as
          guesstimates) are often used in interviews because they require a mix
          of logic, maths and common sense. They can be asked as a standalone
          question or as part of a larger{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/articles/case-interview">
            case interview
          </a>
          . Candidates that are competent with market sizing questions can find
          them extremely easy to execute and if included in an unstructured
          interview it can result in the candidate having an extra 20% time to
          answer other questions.

        <h3>
          <strong>Market Sizing Questions During Your Case Interview</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            All the top tier consulting firms are likely to test their
            candidates with a market sizing question at some stage in the
            process
          </strong>
          as it is considered a “back-of-the-envelope” calculation. For
          instance, you may be sat talking to a UK clothing retailer about their
          growth strategy and someone may put forward the idea of opening an
          e-commerce store the question “how much revenue could we expect to
          generate from an e-commerce store?” and on the back of an envelope (or
          more likely a piece of paper) you could estimate the size of the UK’s
          online clothing market and apply a market capture percentage for the
          client to give them a rough figure. Being quick with these
          calculations keeps the conversation flowing with the client and
          maintains a good impression.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            You can be given a market sizing question as a standalone case
            (though less frequent) or as a part of a broader business situation
            case
          </strong>
          like “
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/market-entry">
            entering a new market
          </a>
          ”. Market Sizing can be tricky since there is no uniquely correct
          answer so be prepared beforehand. In general, the interviewer will be
          less interested in the number you got for the market compared to the
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/interview-first-aid/crack-the-case-interview/approaching-a-case">
            approach
          </a>
          you used to get to that number.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This case type is used to test your&nbsp;
          <strong>quantitative&nbsp;and reasoning skills</strong>. The
          interviewer wants to evaluate whether you are&nbsp;
          <strong>comfortable working with numbers&nbsp;</strong>and whether you
          are capable of making&nbsp;<strong>good assumptions</strong>
          &nbsp;and&nbsp;
          <strong>handle ambiguity</strong>. Market sizing questions are not
          only about sizing markets but also other types of estimations, for
          instance, estimating the number of golf balls in a Jumbo. As you may
          have gathered, maths is important when working through these questions
          as you won’t have a calculator to do the sums. Whilst good long
          multiplication and long division can be extremely beneficial the most
          important thing is being able to handle big numbers such as millions
          and billions as well as percentages. More on this later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, your result should be “in the right ballpark”, meaning the
          answer must&nbsp;
          <strong>
            not be off by more than 20% compared to the actual answer
          </strong>
          . But more than the result, the crucial aspect&nbsp;of this
          problem-solving process is the approach you took, the structure you
          applied, and the way you thought about the problem. If you fail to
          share your approach and the thought process, it is unlikely the
          interviewer will be able to read your mind or give you a pass for the
          case interview.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Segmentation</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you have been reading into consulting interviews before arriving at
          market sizing questions you may have already come across some areas
          where segmentation is required.{" "}
          <strong>
            Segmenting data is a common theme throughout multiple types of
            consulting questions, and it is no different with market sizing
            questions
          </strong>
          . Segmenting is the concept of breaking down large data groups without
          losing any data in the process. The principle you need to understand
          in order to do this correctly is the MECE principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/mece-principle">
            MECE principle
          </a>{" "}
          can be applied to demographics such as populations, used to formulate
          problem statements and to process data sets. In simple terms breaking
          down a data group in a MECE way{" "}
          <strong>
            means creating subgroups that do not overlap, and their sum equals
            the original number i.e no data has gone missing
          </strong>
          . An example useful to know for market sizing questions is how to
          segment a country’s population into age groups (as age groups often
          behave differently):
        </p>
        <p>
          0-17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          = 20%
        </p>
        <p>
          18-34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          = 20%
        </p>
        <p>
          35-49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          =
          20%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          50-64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          = 20%
        </p>
        <p>
          65+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          = 20%
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Notice that none of the groups overlap so no ages get counted twice
            but also no ages are missed
          </strong>
          . Now that the population is segmented properly, we can treat each
          group differently. Continuing with the e-commerce clothing example, if
          we had broken the UK population into the above groups then we could
          estimate the spend per person in those groups and common sense would
          suggest it is likely that the spend per person is less in the 0-17
          group compared to the 18-34 group. We can reason this judgment as the
          majority of the 0-17 group will not be buying their own clothes
          online.​
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Two Essential Frameworks</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The{" "}
          <strong>
            two frameworks that can be used when answering market sizing
            questions
          </strong>{" "}
          are an
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/issue-tree">
            issue tree
          </a>
          or a table. Both can usually get you to an answer so if you are short
          of time then only learn one, but it will definitely make your life
          easier if you can master them both.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is really important to{" "}
          <strong>
            sense check your answer during a market sizing question
          </strong>{" "}
          as it is a test of your business acumen, a candidate that states that
          the global freight market is worth £1 million immediately reveals to
          the interviewer that they are lacking the level of business judgment a
          consultant needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Issue Trees</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          An issue tree (sometimes referred to as a logic tree) is the{" "}
          <strong>
            visual breakdown of a question into its component parts vertically
          </strong>
          . Once you start breaking the question down further it continues in
          the same format to the right eventually leading to a single answer. If
          the question asked you to estimate
          <strong>how many fridges there were in India</strong> you could use an
          issue tree as follows:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img
            src="/uploads/bootcamp/1/type-conversion-1677599664-x49srfndfa3c.webp"
            alt="type-conversion-1677599664-x49srfndfa3c.webp"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Issue trees are a{" "}
          <strong>popular method of answering market sizing questions</strong>{" "}
          because the logic applied is easy to trace and so the interviewer can
          physically see the steps you have made in order to arrive at your
          answer. They are also easy to extend if necessary, as you can bring in
          other branches without disrupting the logic and simply changing the
          calculations required.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using an issue tree, we recommend that you{" "}
          <strong>
            use as much of the page you have available and start with your first
            branch(es) on the left-hand side and then follow these steps
          </strong>
          :
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Draw out your tree with only the branch labels</li>
          <li>
            Turn the page round to the interviewer and confirm that your logic
            is reasonable
          </li>
          <li>Fill in the data that you do know</li>
          <li>
            Ask the interviewer if they are able to fill in any of the blanks
            (they may refuse to fill in any)
          </li>
          <li>
            Fill in the remaining blanks with sensible estimations of your own
            and justify them to the interviewer
          </li>
          <li>Do the required maths</li>
          <li>
            Sense-check your answer (if it seems unreasonable then go back to
            step 5)
          </li>
          <li>State your answer to the interviewer</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Following these 8 steps gives the interviewer{" "}
          <strong>
            chances to course-correct if you have missed or overcomplicated
            something
          </strong>
          and demonstrates your logic and maths skills clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The limitations of an issue tree are easy to see when there is a lot
          of segmenting of the data required within the answer. Whilst the logic
          may be easy to trace still{" "}
          <strong>
            it can make the calculations messy and harder for a reader to
            understand.
          </strong>{" "}
          For a question that involves a large amount of segmenting it is
          usually easy to use a table.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Tabular</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a table to construct your answer is a good method to choose{" "}
          <strong>if you are likely to be breaking a data set down</strong>. The
          breaking down of a population into age groups as shown in the
          segmentation section leaves you with five different groups. In this
          case, it is beneficial to use a table in order to treat each group
          differently. For example, if the question asked you to estimate how
          many people go swimming each week in the UK we may estimate the answer
          using the following table:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img
            src="/uploads/bootcamp/1/type-conversion-1677599772-7m4xeb7napr4.webp"
            alt="type-conversion-1677599772-7m4xeb7napr4.webp"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Each row of the table is a different subgroup whilst each column is
            a different logical step.{" "}
          </strong>
          Some of the steps use the same figures for each group such as hours in
          a day and this makes the maths more time-consuming. An alternative
          would be to move into an issue tree at this point meaning you only
          have to multiply by 24 once.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is helpful to{" "}
          <strong>
            use lined paper if it is available when using a table to answer
            market sizing questions
          </strong>{" "}
          as it keeps the rows clear and legible. For the table framework we
          recommend using the same steps as the issue tree with a slight
          modification to the setup:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Draw out your table with only your row and column labels</li>
          <li>
            Turn the page round to the interviewer and confirm that your logic
            is reasonable
          </li>
          <li>Fill in the data that you do know</li>
          <li>
            Ask the interviewer if they are able to fill in any of the blanks
            (they may refuse to fill in any)
          </li>
          <li>
            Fill in the remaining blanks with sensible estimations of your own
            and justify them to the interviewer
          </li>
          <li>Do the required maths</li>
          <li>
            Sense-check your answer (if it seems unreasonable then go back to
            step 5)
          </li>
          <li>State your answer to the interviewer</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Following these steps will{" "}
          <strong>
            allow you to keep organized when working with multiple subgroups
          </strong>
          . Like the issue tree it is also easy for the interviewer to
          understand your logic and course-correct where necessary.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Market Sizing Questions: Example&nbsp;</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Question:​</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How many fridges are there in India?​</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure a logical answer it is important to apply the MECE framework
          and physically draw out an issue tree. Always talk through your steps
          with the interviewer and they may give you hints if they are looking
          for something specific.&nbsp;A potential answer to the question might
          be:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">

          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          As <strong>the fridges have been segmented into two groups</strong>{" "}
          <strong>(domestic and commercial)</strong>
          using the issue tree has been straightforward. In this example it
          would be easy to only consider fridges in homes and households
          (domestic) but you must always consider any other potential sources.
          If you miss one, it is likely to be a follow-on question the
          interviewer asks; “where else might you find fridges in India?”
          testing your creative thinking and the collectively exhaustive part of
          the MECE framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common question is{" "}
          <strong>
            estimating the number of passengers that pass through an airport and
            the type of aircraft that is often overlooked is cargo planes
          </strong>
          . Whilst they don't carry passengers there is usually a crew of two
          flying the plane and to be collectively exhaustive these need to be
          included. Recognizing this will show the interviewer you are an
          exceptional candidate with a great mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the example through you can see{" "}
          <strong>
            the numbers used are incredibly easy and that isn't by accident,
            round them where it is appropriate but be mindful that you must also
            be able to justify the numbers you choose.
          </strong>{" "}
          An average of one fridge per household can be justified as sensible
          because there will be a wealthy demographic with two fridges but also
          as a country with high poverty levels there will be many households
          without fridges in India. An average of two fridges per business could
          be argued in many ways but things to be considered are restaurants and
          supermarkets that have many versus the small independent businesses
          with none. Remember to explain your logic out loud to the interviewer.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Useful Numbers​</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          A stumbling block for many market sizing questions is the{" "}
          <strong>starting figure</strong>. Often the question is asking you to
          find a subset of a larger group or a number in relation to the larger
          group such as weekly swimmers in the UK or fridges in India. In order
          to do this it is helpful to know the population to start, in these
          instances the populations of the UK and India respectively. The
          following numbers are useful to know before answering market sizing
          questions:​
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>US population = 300 million</li>

          <strong>consultants are often asked by clients</strong>&nbsp;in
          brainstorming sessions or just out of the blue. Having a
          structured&nbsp;approach and being able to analyze what the drivers
          are behind such estimation questions is essential for a useful and
          convincing response.

          While the approach you choose to get to the size of the market is{" "}

          should still be aware that your interviewer might deliberately give
          you assumptions that lead to a much higher or smaller market size than
          what would be reasonable. In this case, make an objection saying that
          the market seems to be much larger/smaller than you would expect. It

          To master the many challenges of a Market Sizing Case, we strongly
          recommend you to&nbsp;always&nbsp;use our{" "}
          <strong>three golden rules</strong> of market sizing discussed below.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>The Three Golden Rules of Market Sizing</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The three golden rules of market sizing will help you to structure and
          present your approach easily, prevent you from making calculation
          mistakes, and check whether you are right in the end.
        </p>
        <p>The three golden rules of market sizing are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use a tree to structure the problem.</li>
          <li>Find the right tradeoff between accuracy and pragmatism.</li>
          <li>Sanity-check your results.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In the following sections, we will look at each of these steps in more
          detail:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Always use an issue tree to structure your problem</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In most market sizing cases, the interviewer has no clue what the
          exact solution is. The final answer does not matter as much as how you
          got there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always draw a calculation tree for the solution of a market sizing
          case: In the first step, layout your whole structure starting from the
          top box (your final objective) going down to the leaves (pieces of
          information that are easier to estimate).
        </p>
        <p>
          You should go to the second step only after your tree is laid out{" "}
          <strong>and</strong>has been validated by the interviewer. The second
          step is when you start making assumptions from the leaves at the
          bottom and calculating the boxes of your tree towards the top (your
          final objective).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if the market you are trying to estimate is the number of
          diapers sold in the US per year, first-level assumptions could look
          something like this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li># of babies in the US at a given day multiplied by</li>
          <li># of diapers a baby uses per day multiplied by</li>
          <li># of days on average in a year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As you can expect, the tree can have a{" "}
          <strong>different number of levels for each of its branches</strong>.
          While you will be able to estimate the average&nbsp;number of days in
          a year fairly accurately, estimating the number of babies in the US
          might require you to break down this box further.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following illustration shows how we can draw a tree to estimate
          how many gas stations can be found in Paris. You can find{" "}
          <a href="/en/management-consulting-cases/interviewer-led-mckinsey-style/intermediate/gas-station-19">
            the entire case
          </a>{" "}
          in our <a href="/en/management-consulting-cases">Case Library</a>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img
            src="/uploads/bootcamp/1/type-conversion-1677599952-rk5ju8qawuih.webp"
            alt="type-conversion-1677599952-rk5ju8qawuih.webp"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Splitting the process into two steps, first structure then
          calculation, simplifies the problem a lot. Why is that? Because your
          brain has two separate hemispheres: the right (creative) and the left
          (rational). While the right side is good at conceptually putting
          together all the factors that are needed for the estimation, the left
          side is good at number crunching.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you mix up structure&nbsp;and calculations, you will fail to focus
          on one of the hemispheres at a time and will not use your brain to its
          full potential. Therefore, first, establish and validate a tree
          structure and only afterwards concentrate on crunching the numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Find the trade-off between pragmatism and accuracy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Rounding numbers in a market sizing case is inevitable unless you are
          a genius or the data is very simple. But do not round them without
          asking the interviewer if he is fine with it. He might want to assess
          your accuracy when calculating something.
        </p>
        <p>Always keep an eye on the right balance:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not round more than 10%.</li>
          <li>
            If possible, round some numbers up and some down in order to cancel
            out your rounding errors.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Make use of averages if you do not have much time left or if the
          problem is already too complicated. Segment the data otherwise. For
          example, we took an average of 5 pumps for the Paris gas stations case
          above. Another option would be to segment gas stations into big,
          medium, and small gas stations in a further tree level.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case you decide to segment the data, try to come up with 3
          segments, as three is the number that people like most. You'll find it
          in everyday life: First, business, economy class; children, adult,
          elderly; etc. Also, never forget to be&nbsp;MECE&nbsp;(mutually
          exclusive and collectively exhaustive) in your segmentation.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <div class="highlight-box highlight-box-light-grey js-highlight-box">
          A common question for market sizing cases is 'H
          <i>ow deep do I have to go for each of the branches?</i>'. As a rule
          of thumb, you need to go as deep as you need to be able to make only{" "}
          <strong>defensible assumptions.</strong>
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>
            3. Try to do sanity checks along the way and definitely at the end
            of the case
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You might make mistakes throughout a market sizing case.
          However,&nbsp;with sanity checks, you may be able to detect them in
          time. For example, when you have to assess the yearly revenues of a
          company, compare them to the revenues of a competitor of a similar
          size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, it is important to know&nbsp;
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/practice-your-basics/important-facts">
            facts&nbsp;like the population numbers
          </a>{" "}
          or the GDP of different countries!&nbsp;This will help you evaluate
          the correctness of your numbers. If, for instance, your calculation
          results in 400 million women wearing red pullovers in the USA, you
          will know that this is impossible because the population of the US is
          ~330 million.&nbsp;

        <h3>
          <strong>The Replacement Concept</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The replacement concept will help you to estimate numbers that are
            hard to guesstimate.{" "}
          </strong>
          For some case problems, guesstimating the right numbers is even more
          complicated if you follow the reasoning induced by the interviewer.
          If, for example, you had to estimate the number of babies being born
          per year, you would likely get into trouble when you reach the stage
          where you need to define the number of babies being born per woman per
          year. To avoid these pitfalls, think instead&nbsp;of the big picture.
          Think about how many years it takes for the population to be replaced.
          Watch the following videos in order to see the replacement concept
          applied in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this first video, PrepLounge's Co-Founder and
          Expert&nbsp;Fernando&nbsp;demonstrates how to use the replacement
          concept on the market-sizing case "How many babies are being born per
          day&nbsp;in the world".
        </p>
        <p>
          For further practice, Fernando uses the replacement concept on the
          market-sizing case "How many cars are sold in the US per day".
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, see how Fernando applies the replacement concept on a tricky
          market-sizing case "How many incandescent light bulbs are sold in
          Germany per year".

        <ul>
          <li>
            Quantitative and reasoning skills are the key to success.&nbsp;Train
            them, for example with a <a href="/en/case-partner">Case Partner</a>{" "}

          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure to ask the interviewer if you can round the numerical
            answers.
          </li>
          <li>Estimations off by 20% are good enough.</li>
          <li>
            When estimating markets of products that need to be replaced on a
            regular basis (refrigerators, laptops, cars, light bulbs, etc.), use
            the replacement concept.
