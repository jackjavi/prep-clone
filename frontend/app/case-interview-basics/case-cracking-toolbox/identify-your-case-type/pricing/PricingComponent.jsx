        <p>
          After familiarizing yourself with the company's business model, it's
          time to <strong>learn more about the product</strong>. When examining
          the product, it's important to pay attention to the following aspects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Product differentiation:</strong> Analyze how the client's
            product differs from those of competitors. Explore not only the
            product's features but also its production processes and methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unique Selling Proposition (USP):</strong> Identify the
            unique selling point of the product. What makes it unique and
            attractive to potential customers?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alternatives and substitutes: </strong>Consider alternative
            or substitute products in the market as well. How do they compare to
            the client's product?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Product lifecycle: </strong>Determine the stage of the{" "}
            <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/product-life-cycle">

            </a>
            . This can influence the pricing and marketing strategy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Predictability of supply and demand:</strong> Examine
            whether{" "}

            for the product are predictable. This can help assess risks in
            pricing and take appropriate measures.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once you've thoroughly assessed these aspects, you'll have a clearer
          understanding of the product and its positioning in the market, which
          will inform your pricing strategy recommendations.

        <h2>
          <strong>3. Choose a Pricing Strategy&nbsp;</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The choice of strategy depends on the information gathered in the
          first two steps. There are three important pricing strategies:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>(1) Competitor-based pricing </strong>(
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/benchmarking">
            <u>Benchmarking</u>
          </a>
          ): With this strategy, the price is determined based on the prices set
          by our competitors. So, you want to find out:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are there comparable products/services?</li>
          <li>If yes, how do they compare to the client's product?</li>
          <li>
            What are their prices? Important: Keep in mind that competitors are
            likely to adjust their prices once the client introduces their
            product.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2) Cost-based pricing:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          With cost-based pricing, the price of a product or service is set
          based on the <strong>accumulated item costs</strong> (
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/break-even-analysis">
            <u>break-even</u>
          </a>
          ) plus a reasonable profit margin. This strategy varies by industry
          due to different cost structures and margins. Therefore, it's
          important to understand the specific customer costs before setting a
          price (taking into account{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/fixed-variable-costs">
            <u>fixed and variable costs</u>
          </a>
          ).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Although cost-based pricing offers a simple and transparent method, it
          does not consider the perceived value of the product or service to
          customers and may be<strong> less effective</strong> in certain
          markets. To determine customer willingness to pay, it's important to
          consider this and possibly break down the price into different
          components, such as a separate price for the product and delivery
          costs.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3) Value-based pricing:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Value-based pricing is a strategic approach based on assessing the
          customer's perception of the product or the amount customers are
          willing to pay. Different customer segments may have different{" "}
          <strong>willingness to pay</strong>. This means that companies can set
          different prices for different customer segments by adjusting the
          perceived value to justify price changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A good example of this is the iPhone, a highly differentiated product
          for which customers are often willing to pay significantly more than
          the pure costs plus a "typical" margin. This illustrates how customers
          are inclined to accept a higher price for products they perceive as{" "}
          <strong>particularly valuable</strong> or{" "}
          <strong>differentiated</strong>.
        </p>

          <strong>Key Takeaways</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          From what we've learned previously, we can now extract the following
          insights as key takeaways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are three key pricing strategies:{" "}
            <strong>Competitor-based pricing, cost-based pricing, </strong>and{" "}
            <strong>value-based pricing</strong>. Cost-based pricing alone is
            sometimes considered insufficient.
          </li>
          <li>
            Understand the primary<strong> objective of the company </strong>
            (profit, market share, growth, brand positioning) as the basis for
            the pricing strategy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Know the <strong>business model, products/services,</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>market position</strong> of the company and consider it in
            your strategic approach.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Understand the customers' <strong>willingness to pay</strong> and
              needs, and adjust the pricing strategy to customer preferences and
              market conditions.
            </p>
