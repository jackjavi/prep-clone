            In a Competitive Response Case, You Either Need to Analyze Your
            Client's or Its Competitorsâ€™ Moves
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          In a competitive response case, your job is either to analyze what
          your client should do in response to a major competitor's strategy or
          to anticipate what competitors will do in response to a strategy
          implemented by your client.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as with{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/ma">

          cases, competitive response cases by themselves are rare. Instead,
          these case types will come disguised as part of a larger business
          problem.&nbsp;In competitive response cases, it is important to get a
          good understanding of the current situation and how it can be
          addressed.

            1. Understand the status quo and changes in order to assess the
            relevance of competitive response
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Here too, make sure you fully understand the current situation and how
          it has changed compared to the past. If, for instance, the case is
          about the main competitor having introduced a new product, then you
          will want to know the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What is the nature of the product and how does it differ from what
            the client offers?
            <ol>
              <li>
                How important are the new different features to customers?
              </li>
              <li>
                What will the new features enable the competitor to do? In
                general, there are two possibilities: a competitor can either
                charge a higher{" "}

                </a>{" "}
                for the competing product or take customers away from our client
                by pricing the product with the differentiating feature
                competitively against the clients' products.
              </li>
              <li>
                Why is the competitor introducing it? For instance, have
                customer preferences changed (need pull) or is there an
                availability of new technology (technology push)?
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Which market segment is addressed with the new product and how do we
            expect these market segments to react?
          </li>
          <li>
            Does the client possess resources that could be used in the context
            of the new product (expertise, funds,&nbsp;M&amp;A options,
            production facilities, etc.)?
          </li>
        </ul>

          <strong>2. Possible recommendations</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          There is a variety of potential answers to new product introductions.
          Often, what an interviewer is trying to assess here is your creativity
          and ability to produce realistic solutions. Potential answers could
          be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make the current product more attractive:
            <ol>
              <li>Redesign, repackage the current product.</li>
              <li>
                Change the market segment of the current product (move upmarket
                or downmarket).
              </li>
              <li>
                Increase the marketing activity (i.e<i>.,</i> increase perceived
                attractiveness).
              </li>
              <li>
                Build customer loyalty or increase switching costs (e.g., by
                adding a loyalty scheme).
              </li>
              <li>
                Make another dimension of the product more
                attractive&nbsp;(e.g.,&nbsp;cut&nbsp;

            </ol>

                Acquire&nbsp;the competitor or capabilities for the new product.
              </li>
              <li>
                Copy the competitor with the client's available resources.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Do nothing:
            <ol>
              <li>Doing nothing can indeed be a recommendation.</li>
              <li>
                Doing nothing can be a strategy if you want to wait for more
                information so that you are in a better position to make a
                decision.
