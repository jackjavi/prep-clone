          <strong>
            Use the following five steps to approach a market entry case
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            1. Paraphrase and clarify the objective at the beginning (same as
            all other cases)
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As usual, take good notes! Start with paraphrasing the problem and
          clarify all questions to make sure you understand the
          problem.&nbsp;Take a minute to{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts">
            structure your thoughts
          </a>{" "}
          and decide the questions you want to ask based on the structure. In
          short, in order to have a market entry strategy, you need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Understand the company and its current market, and also the new
            market the company wants to enter.
          </li>
          <li>Evaluate the financial aspects.</li>
          <li>
            Evaluate the economic implications of entering the market. If it
            makes sense, decide how: Through organic (independently) or
            inorganic (inter-dependently)? If inorganic, then would it be
            through a Joint Venture or&nbsp;M&amp;A?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Frameworks such as&nbsp;
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/porters-five-forces">
            Porter's Five Forces
          </a>
          &nbsp;can help you structure thoughts and systematically uncover key
          information. But, in an interview, avoid saying that you are using
          Porter's Five Forces or any other standard framework as you run the
          risk of portraying yourself as force-fitting a framework.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Understand the client's company</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Understand why the client wants to enter the new market and identify
          the key issue. Knowing this piece of information will be important in
          making the final recommendation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Other important information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are current revenue streams?</li>
          <li>
            What are the client's key strengths and weaknesses? (

              SWOT

            )
          </li>
          <li>
            What is the product mix? How many and what types of product lines,
            brands, variations of products does the company have? What is the{" "}
            <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/product-life-cycle">
              lifecycle
            </a>{" "}
            of each product?&nbsp;Also, how closely related are the current
            products?
          </li>
          <li>Who are current customers, and how are they segmented?</li>
          <li>What are the current distribution channels?</li>
          <li>
            What is the client's current{" "}

            ?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Understand the market of interest</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Understand the market the client wants to enter and evaluate its
          attractiveness. Start by estimating the{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/market-sizing">
            market size
          </a>{" "}
          if that information is available (it is implied that you would first
          need to estimate market size in such cases).

          <li>
            What are the customer segments, and what are their respective needs?
          </li>
          <li>
            Is there a key technology involved? If so, how quickly is it likely
            to change?
          </li>
          <li>What are current trends in the industry?</li>
          <li>
            Who are the&nbsp;key players&nbsp;in the market? What is their
            market share? What are their differentiating factors?
          </li>
          <li>What is their response to the determined key trends?</li>
          <li>Are there&nbsp;substitute products?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Evaluate the financial aspects</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Key questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Costs: What are barriers to market entry (i.e. investment costs)?
          </li>
          <li>Costs: What are expected fixed and variable costs?</li>
          <li>
            Revenues: What is the expected price of the product for and how many
            units are expected to be sold?
          </li>
          <li>
            After how many years will the client break-even&nbsp;and what is the
            rate of return (
            <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/net-present-value-npv">
              understand that money has a different value over time
            </a>
            )?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>
            5. Evaluate the economic implications of entering the market
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember you do not need to investigate&nbsp;
          <strong>all&nbsp;</strong>these questions, but you do need to evaluate
          and understand what questions are important by considering the reasons
          the client wants to enter the market.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you decide that entering a new market is a good idea, it would make
          sense to recommend to the client&nbsp;<strong>how to do it</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Entering a new market can be generally done in three key ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start from scratch</li>
          <li>Through a Joint Venture</li>
          <li>Through&nbsp;M&amp;A</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Based on the data, if you decide that the venture is not a good idea,
          recommend an alternative plan (product differentiation, cost-cutting,
          international presence, etc.). Since you now know the company
          structure, the “old” and the "new" market, make sure to structure your
          recommendation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Competitive advantage</strong>: Can you apply the same
            business strategy as in your current market, or do you have to adapt
            the product, marketing, or even sales channels to reach customers?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Timing:</strong>&nbsp;Can you lever a first-mover advantage,
            or would you rather let the competitors try their luck first?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Speed of entry:</strong>&nbsp;Define whether you want to
            test a single store or region, or whether you want to cover the
            entire market at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Entry mode:</strong>&nbsp;How much commitment are you
            looking at? Would it be a simple export strategy, where you can exit
            easily but have less control, OR a wholly owned subsidy, where
            investment costs are high, but you also have more control?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The organizational structure</strong>&nbsp;of the new
            branch: Do you want to decide centrally or leave lots of freedom to
            the individual manager of the country?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once you have all your answers, synthesize them to give a
          recommendation based on the facts you collected. Don't forget to take
          another minute to structure your answer but make sure to provide your
          answer first and then the reasons! Check out&nbsp;our article about
