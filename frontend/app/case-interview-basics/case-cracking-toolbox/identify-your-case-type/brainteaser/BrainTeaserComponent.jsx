          <strong>
            Brainteaser in case interviews are used to assess your ability to
            think quickly and out-of-the-box
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Brainteaser are a special sub-category of cases. In contrast to
          regular cases, they are less focused on multifaceted business problems
          and more on a single issue. The goal is to&nbsp;solve&nbsp;a problem
          that is usually not straightforward and requires&nbsp;
          <strong>out-of-the-box thinking</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typical problems cover everyday life's topics and might even include
          unrealistic assumptions. All necessary information is usually included
          in the question so that further assumptions are not necessary.
          Questions to the interviewer should focus on presenting solution
          approaches and checking if they will lead to the solution.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>What should you expect during brainteasers?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          First, in consulting{" "}
          <a href="/en/articles/case-interview">case interviews</a>,
          brainteasers are rarely used.{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/management-consulting-cases">
            Regular cases
          </a>{" "}
          are considered more suitable as they allow the interviewer to better
          test key skills needed in a consultant (structured, analytical and
          conceptual thinking).
        </p>
        <p>
          During business cases, interviewers can add value through their
          expertise and a more fruitful and realistic interaction may arise,
          which is more in alignment to that of a consultant's daily life.
          Nevertheless, brainteasers provide the interviewer with valuable
          insights into the candidate's potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brainteaser are an&nbsp;<strong>additional challenge</strong>&nbsp;to
          the candidate. They require a solution path different from standard
          frameworks.&nbsp; The candidate’s ability to recognize, structure, and
          solve problems is tested at a different level. The necessary insights
          are usually hidden in the starting question&nbsp;and&nbsp;need to be
          deduced. For some brainteaser, an information overload can cover the
          essential hints. As a result, brainteaser put candidates under&nbsp;
          <strong>stress</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a candidate, practicing brainteasers helps to focus on certain
          aspects. You can&nbsp;
          <strong>
            train your creativity, math skills, and logical thinking
          </strong>
          &nbsp;with different questions. Because brainteasers require
          out-of-the-box thinking, you become more&nbsp;
          <strong>flexible in using and developing frameworks</strong>&nbsp;and
          solution paths. They also help to avoid excessive usage of standard
          frameworks.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>How to solve brainteaser?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          As with all case studies, the structure leading towards the solution
          of a consulting brainteaser is more important than actually finding
          the final answer.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Write down</strong>&nbsp;every piece of information you get.
            Listen very carefully because one specific word can convey the
            answer.&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;the question to make sure
            you didn’t add or miss anything important.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think of solutions or required information you might need&nbsp;
            <strong>without looking at the facts</strong>. There are three
            possibilities:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You’ll find a solution without any information. Sometimes common
            sense brainteasers can be solved this way. In this case, the only
            purpose of the starting&nbsp;information&nbsp;is to confuse you.
          </li>
          <li>Both needed and given information match.</li>
          <li>
            You need further information in order to be able to solve the
            brainteaser. In this case, convey to the interviewer how you would
            have solved it if that information were available. This will
            demonstrate your creativity.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Take notes of&nbsp;<strong>solutions that didn’t work</strong>
            &nbsp;and communicate the reason to the interviewer. Clearly
            communicate the reasons that would prevent you from repeating a
            similar analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the problem visible through{" "}
            <strong>schematics&nbsp;and graphs</strong>. These habits foster
            creative thinking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put yourself in the&nbsp;
            <strong>shoes of the person affected</strong>&nbsp;by the issue
            addressed by the consulting brainteaser. If the problem were your
            own, you might tackle it more creatively.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            Quantitative brainteaser are about translating verbal problems into

        <h4>
          <strong>Solve with equations</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          When you’re confronted with numbers, such as rates, percentages,
          amounts, or a time, try to set up an equation. While brainteasers
          don’t require sophisticated&nbsp;
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/practice-your-basics/math-skills-required-in-case-interviews">
            math skills
          </a>
          , they do require the knowledge of translating a verbal problem into
          variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;A man's youth lasted one-sixth of his
          life. He grew a beard after one twelfth more. After one seventh more
          of his life, he married. 5 years later, he and his wife had a son. The
          son lived exactly half as long as his father. The man died four years
          after his son.
        </p>
        <p>How many years did the man live?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;The brainteaser requires you to
          formulate the facts into an equation. First, define the missing value.
          The question asks for the number of years he lived, so represent the
          age of death with the variable x. Then sum up the different periods of
          his life, which are either given as a fraction of his lifespan or as
          an absolute number.
          <br />
          <br />
          x/6 + x/12 + x/7 + 5 + x/2 + 4 = x<br />
          <br />
          The solution of the equation is x = 84. The man lived for 84 years.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>Brute Force</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          When the problem asks for a specific number, go for the trial and
          error approach. It is an efficient method if you know the possible
          number of solutions is restricted to just a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong>Replace all 'x' with all the digits 1,
          2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to make the statement true: &nbsp;xx * x = xxx
          <br />
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;Instead of thinking about a
          complicated arithmetic solution, just plug in numbers until you reach
          the solution.
        </p>
        <p>54 * 3 = 162</p>

            Qualitative brainteaser are about drawing the right conclusions out

        <h4>
          <strong>Solve with Logic</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Most brainteaser can be solved logically by inferring the right
          conclusions out of the given information. While that is, to a certain
          extent, necessary for every brainteaser, some will require special
          logical thinking. Make sure to prove that you draw the right logical
          conclusions from the given information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong>Five friends bought 10 cookies. To
          distribute the cookies, they have agreed to a rule: according to the
          order of their initial letters in the alphabet, Anton, Betty, Carl,
          Danielle, and Emily each make a suggestion on how to split the
          cookies. So Anton starts first and Emily is last. A person is kicked
          out (and consequently doesn't receive any cookies) if they don't
          secure at least 50% of the votes with their suggestion. In that case,
          the next one makes a suggestion until an agreement is reached. What is
          the maximum Anton can demand without being kicked out?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;Backwards induction will provide you
          with the answer. It is difficult to start right away with Anton’s
          decision, as we don’t know what the others would decide. So we have to
          figure out the others' decisions first:
        </p>
        <p>
          If the game continues long enough for Emily to make a suggestion, she
          will be the only one left. So she will give herself everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Danielle decides, she and Emily are left. Whatever Danielle says
          will be the final decision, because she makes up 50% of the votes. So
          Danielle will take everything herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Carl decides, he has to convince at least one of the other two
          girls left. If he gives 1 cookie to Emily and keeps 9, Emily will
          agree because if Emily doesn’t agree, Danielle will decide. The case
          above then occurs, where Emily gets nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Betty decides, she also has to convince one of the other three left
          to receive 50% of the votes. If she gives 1 cookie to Danielle and
          keeps 9, Danielle will agree. If Danielle doesn’t agree, Carl decides.
          The case above then occurs, where Danielle gets nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Anton decides, he needs two votes. If he gives 1 cookie to Carl, 1
          to Emily and keeps 8, both Carl and Emily will agree because they are
          better off this way. If they don’t agree, Betty will decide. The case
          above then&nbsp;occurs, where Carl and Emily receive nothing.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, Anton can demand at max 8 cookies.</p>
        <h4>
          <strong>Solve with Brute Force</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Similar to mathematical questions, if you get a brainteaser with a
          restricted amount of possible solutions, try a backward approach.
          First, assume one of the solutions is correct and see if it works with
          the information you were given.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example</strong>: I have a horse. Do you know what color it
          is? Allan said, "I guess it is not black". Brian said, "It is either
          brown or gray". Charlie said, "I know it is brown". I said, "At least
          one of you is right and at least one of you is wrong." What is the
          color of my horse if the color is one of the above?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;The horse is brown, black, or gray. So
          three options you have to check:
          <br />
          If the horse is brown, then everyone is right. This is not the
          answer.&nbsp;If the horse is black, then everyone is wrong. This isn't
          the answer, either. Therefore, the horse is gray. To verify the
          answer, Allan was right, Brian was right, but Charlie was wrong.
        </p>
