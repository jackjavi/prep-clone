          One of the most common reasons why firms instruct{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/articles/consulting-firms">
            <u>consulting firms</u>
          </a>{" "}
          with their projects is that they{" "}
          <strong>struggle with their profitability.</strong> As a consultant
          you will have to diagnose the underlying issues, come up with
          potential solutions and recommend actions to improve
          profitability.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As a candidate in a case interview, the task is pretty much the same,
          but on a smaller scale. The good news is: Once you have understood the
          basic structure of profitability cases, you can solve them no matter
          the industry or concrete business scenario. The underlying concept is
          always the same and not very difficult.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Profitability issues always stem from{" "}
          <strong>falling revenues</strong>, <strong>rising costs</strong>, or{" "}
          <strong>both</strong>. It is as simple as that. Your task will be
          two-fold: Perform a structured and quantitative analysis of the data
          to isolate the problem, and then find a promising solution. In most
          cases, you can use the profitability framework to structure the
          problem, but make sure to not blindly apply it, but really understand
          the problem at hand and make adjustments as needed in the concrete
          business scenario.&nbsp;

        </h3>
        <p>
          The Profitability Framework is a fundamental tool for approaching
          profitability cases. It is basically an{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/issue-tree">
            <u>issue tree</u>
          </a>{" "}
          that breaks down profitability into its key components: revenues and
          costs.
        </p>
        <figure class="image">

          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          In the first place, this equation is pretty straightforward and not
          complicated at all. Next, it is your task to understand each side of
          the equation and identify the cause for declining profitability. There
          could be <strong>three reasons</strong>:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Revenues have been declining.&nbsp;</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Costs have been increasing.&nbsp;</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Revenues have been declining <u>and</u> costs have been
              increasing.&nbsp;
            </strong>
            <br />
            (Always make sure to remember this option. It happens pretty easily
            that candidates identify either revenue or cost issues as the
            problem, completely focus on one side of the issue tree and forget
            to zoom out again, take a look at the big picture and consider the
            other side of the equation as well.)&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          So, the first question to get an answer to is ‚ÄúHave revenues been
          declining?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHave costs been increasing?‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHave revenues been
          declining <u>and</u> costs been increasing? And if so, which one is
          the bigger problem?‚Äù. Whenever you get the information that something
          has changed: <strong>Quantify it!</strong> Ask by how much and in what
          time period. Depending on the answer, you will know on which side of
          your profitability tree you need to start your analysis. Always start
          with the most relevant driver (
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/pareto-principle">
            <u>Pareto Principle</u>
          </a>
          ).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>üí° Pro Tip: </strong>When trying to find out where to start
          your analysis, keep in mind to communicate like a consultant. A Bainie
          would not go to the client and bluntly ask ‚ÄúHave your revenues been
          declining?‚Äù, but rather formulate a question like ‚ÄúHow have your
          revenues been developing over the past five years?‚Äù. It may be
          possible that your interviewer will then share an exhibit with you
          that not only contains revenue information, but also valuable insights
          on product lines, geographies or other relevant data, which you can
          use throughout the case.&nbsp;
          <br />
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>Scenario 1: Revenues have been declining.</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Let‚Äôs assume, the profitability problem stems from declining revenues.
          There are many potential reasons for this and you need to find out
          which one applies in order to come up with a solution. Most important
          for your analysis is to stay structured at all times.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Understand how the business makes revenue.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To structure your analysis of declining revenues, you need to
          understand the business model of the company you advise. So basically
          answer the questions:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How does this company make revenue?</li>
          <li>What does the revenue consist of?</li>
          <li>Which component of the revenue has been declining?&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Understanding your client‚Äôs business model is absolutely crucial for
          your revenue analysis. Only when you know which products the company
          sells and which customers it serves, will you be able to give solid
          advice on how to solve profitability problems.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Break down the revenue into its single components.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have understood the general business model of your client,
          you can go on and break down the revenue into its components.
          Depending on the business model of the company, the equation can
          differ.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let‚Äôs take a look at some examples depending on different
          industries:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          It becomes obvious that there is{" "}
          <strong>no one-size-fits-all-solution</strong> for a revenue analysis.
          You need to adjust your approach according to the client‚Äôs business
          model and needs.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>
            3. Analyze the single components of the revenue model.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have a clear picture of what the revenue of your client is
          composed of, you can go on with your analysis by focusing on the
          component of the equation that appears to be the problem. For example,
          if your client is a manufacturer with declining revenues, you should
          find out if the number of units sold has been decreasing or the
          selling price per unit has been lowered (or a combination of both).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <strong>number of units</strong> sold has decreased, you go on
          with a further analysis on the reasons behind. These can be manifold,
          so make sure to stay structured and use segmentation to get to the
          root cause of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The segmentation you use needs to be customized to the case at hand.
          Make sure to let your interviewer know your thoughts and guide him or
          her through the case. That way, you will usually get valuable hints on
          which direction to go.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Examples for segmentations are:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Product segmentation:</strong> Product types? Price ranges?
            Packaging sizes?&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Customer segmentation: </strong>Small / medium-sized / large
            businesses? Age groups? Sex? Income groups?&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Market segmentation: </strong>Geographies? Industry
            verticals?&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Channel segmentation:</strong> Distribution channels?&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you‚Äôve found the biggest driver of the problem, you oftentimes have
          to switch to a more qualitative framework (for example the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/4c-framework">
            4 Cs
          </a>
          ) to find the underlying root cause. For example: when you have less
          revenue, but the price is the same and units sold dropped, you have to
          find out why. Is there a new competitor on the market? Do you have
          quality problems, or did you just stop a marketing initiative that you
          ran for years prior to this drop?&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The same procedure applies if <strong>pricing </strong>seems to be the
          issue for declining revenues. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs increase prices‚Äù might be an easy
          recommendation to give, but most likely too easy to be valuable. It is
          crucial to understand first, why prices have decreased and again, the
          reasons might be diverse. Make sure to use a structured approach in
          order to pinpoint the exact problem.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Possible reasons and forces for decreasing prices may be:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Internal:&nbsp;</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Increased Supply: </strong>Overproduction or excess
                inventory can lead to discounted pricing to clear out stock.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Competitive Pricing:</strong> Aggressive pricing
                strategies by competitors can force companies to lower prices to
                remain competitive.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>External:&nbsp;</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Price Sensitivity of Customers: </strong>Changes in
                customer price sensitivity and purchasing behavior can influence
                demand and pricing strategies.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Market Saturation:</strong> Increased competition and
                market saturation can lead to price wars and downward pressure
                on prices.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Economic Conditions:</strong> Economic downturns or
                recessions can impact consumer purchasing power and demand for
                products.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Exchange Rates: </strong>Fluctuations in exchange rates
                can affect import/export prices and overall cost structure.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It may not be surprising that when looking out for the reasons of the
          client‚Äôs revenue problem, <strong>staying structured</strong> is most
          important. Come up with solid hypotheses and validate or neglect them
          in the dialogue with your interviewer and based on the data that will
          be provided to you throughout the conversation. This requires
          flexibility and spontaneity, so learning frameworks by heart will not
          help you here. It is important to internalize the way of thinking a
          consultant uses and solve cases with peers to put it into
          practice.&nbsp;

          <strong>4. Recommend actions to get revenues back on track.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have successfully narrowed down the problem, there is one
          last thing for you to do: Come up with actions that get your
          profitability back on track. Most likely these will be actions to
          improve your revenues (also increasing the total value of your
          business), but there is a slight chance that at this point of your
          case, you may have to take a look at the big picture again and
          consider cost cutting measures as well.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever you do, don‚Äôt get too excited before you have crossed the
          finish line. Even at this final stage of your case interview, one
          thing is absolutely crucial. You might have guessed it:
          <strong> Structure!&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Don‚Äôt come up with a random list of possible solutions. Prioritize
          them based on their impact and categorize them, for instance by
          short-term or long-term actions or according to the difficulty of
          implementation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, remember to communicate your outcome of the
          analysis answer-first. Start with what the client should do and then
          go on with the reasons behind.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>
          <strong>Scenario 2: Costs have been increasing.&nbsp;</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          If revenues have been flat or increasing, but profitability is going
          down, your client might have a cost problem. The task for you as a
          consultant (or candidate in a case interview) is the same as for
          scenario 1: Identify the cause(s) and come up with recommendations to
          solve the problem. Use a structured approach for your analysis and
          communicate clearly what you are doing while working through your
          case.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            1. Understand the business model and general cost structure of your
            client.&nbsp;
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you can start to analyze the cost issue(s) of your client in
          detail, you need to understand what the business is actually doing and
          which business model is behind. The question of how the company makes
          money and which industry it is in, already implies which cost
          structure may be behind. For example, a service company will most
          likely have labor costs as its main cost driver while a manufacturing
          company will most likely have high spendings on raw materials. So,
          before you dig deeper into the cost structure of your client, get a
          better understanding of its business model first.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Break down the costs into its single components.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To start off with your cost analysis, you need to develop a structured
          approach first. Segment your costs into different categories (and
          remember the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/mece-principle">
            <u>MECE principle</u>
          </a>{" "}
          while doing so). A common way to break down the costs is to
          differentiate between{" "}

            <u>fixed and variable costs</u>
          </a>
          . Fixed costs do not vary with production or sales volume while
          variable costs change in proportion to the sold goods or
          services.&nbsp;

          <strong>
            3. Analyze the single components of your cost structure.&nbsp;
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you know which component of your total costs has increased, you
          can go one step further down your issue tree and focus on that
          component first. But always remember to stay structured and segment as
          you go on identifying the root cause of your profitability
          issue.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If your <strong>fixed costs</strong> appear to be the problem, you
          would go on by separating different cost categories (e.g. rent or
          lease expenses, salaries, utilities etc.) and taking a closer look at
          each one of them. Based on the business you are advising, you should
          make educated guesses on which cost categories may be the most
          relevant ones and start with these ones first. Let your interviewer
          know your thoughts and he or she will guide you in the right
          direction.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          If your <strong>variable costs</strong> appear to be the problem, you
          would go on with splitting these costs into its components. The
          equation is the following:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img

            alt="type-conversion-1714488032-qsyd1jz4e8kw.webp"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Variable Costs = Number of Units&nbsp; √ó Cost per Unit&nbsp;
          </strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Number of Units </strong>is the total quantity of units
          produced or sold.
          <br />
          <strong>Cost per Unit </strong>is the cost incurred to produce one
          unit of product, excluding fixed costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          Remember to adjust the equation to the business model of your client.
          Which units are we talking about? Which kind of cost per unit do we
          need to consider? The equation might look different depending on
          whether your client is a manufacturer or service company, so it is
          important to<strong> internalize these basic approaches</strong> and
          adjust them flexibly to your case.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the composure of the variable costs is clear, you will go on by
          analyzing either side of the equation. Start with the one that seems
          to be more relevant first. Let your interviewer know why you would
          want to focus on that and receive feedback if you are on the right
          track.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, you will most likely be able to quantify the cause of
          your rising costs and need to get <strong>more qualitative </strong>in
          the identification of possible reasons. Don‚Äôt make random guesses, but
          think before you speak and stay structured. For example, you could
          start off by differentiating internal or external reasons. If the
          problem seems to be internal, you could go on by working through the
          value chain. It is important that each of your steps follows a
          comprehensible logic.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Your procedure highly depends on the case you were given and there is
          no standard framework that will help you out at this point. But don‚Äôt
          worry: With a good amount of practice, you can develop the mindset of
          a consultant and significantly improve your performance. We recommend{" "}
          <strong>at least 10-15 mock interviews </strong>with peers before the
          final day, so check out our{" "}

          <strong>4. Recommend actions to improve profitability</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a last step, identify actions that help your client get its
          profitability back on track. If rising costs are your main issue, cost
          cutting measures may seem obvious. However, there may be cases where
          rising costs are your main problem, but there is not much you can do
          about it (e.g. if the prices for necessary raw materials increase due
          to climate changes), so remember to{" "}
          <strong>keep the big picture in mind</strong>, zoom out and do not
          forget that measures to increase revenues might also be a good
          solution to your profitability issue.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Categorize, structure and prioritize your recommendations. What are
          the most important measures and why? Make sure to communicate the
          outcome of your analysis and the corresponding recommendations
          clearly. You have made it this far, so stay concentrated until the end
          of the case and leave a lasting impression.

        <p>
          This is the worst scenario your client could possibly face.

          in a case interview?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is actually quite simple. First, you need to understand which one
          is the bigger problem or the problem you have more scope of action to
          address: Decreasing revenues or increasing costs. Focus on that
          problem first and follow the procedure you have learned in scenario 1
          and 2. If you notice, you are going down the wrong path, go up your
          issue tree again and take the other branch. Not validating your
          initial hypothesis is always fine as long as you communicate it
          clearly to your interview and stay structured in everything you
          do.&nbsp;

          <strong>Profitability Case Example&nbsp;</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Let‚Äôs take a look at a profitability case example just like the ones
          you might encounter in your case interview:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Your client is a chewing gum manufacturer. The CEO of the
          manufacturing company is concerned because her company is experiencing
          declining profitability. Please investigate the reasons for the
          decline and give suggestions for improvement.

          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Clarify the problem</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Start off by making sure you have understood the question correctly. A
          good way to do so restating the problem: ‚ÄúJust so we are on the same
          page, our main objective is to determine the reasons behind the
          decline in profitability for a chewing gum manufacturer and provide
          recommendations to improve the profitability of the business, is that
          correct?‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          You can then go on and ask further questions to better understand the
          structure of the company and industry. What is the size of the
          company? Which kind of chewing gum do they sell? Who are the
          customers? What is the price of the product and how does it compare
          with competitors? Who are the key players in the industry?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask what you need to know to understand the situation of the customer
          and take notes. Summarize your findings, collect feedback from the
          interviewer if you have understood everything correctly and go on with
          the preparation of your structure.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Prepare your structure</strong>
        </p>
        <p>‚ÄúThank you, may I take a minute to prepare my structure?‚Äù&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Based on the term ‚Äúdeclining profitability‚Äù in the case prompt
          (‚Äúfalling sales‚Äù or ‚Äúrising costs‚Äù can also be hints), it is valid to
          assume a profitability case and work the corresponding framework as a
          basis for your structure. But be careful: Don‚Äôt jump to conclusions
          too fast and make sure in step 1 that you have really understood the
          situation of your client and prepare a structure that is customized
          for it. Off-the-shelve-frameworks are never a good idea - neither in
          case interviews nor in the real consulting world.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, we do have a profitability case that can be analyzed by using
          the <strong>profitability equation</strong> to isolate and quantify
          the problem:&nbsp;

          When profits go down, you either have a decline in revenue, rising
          costs, or both. The best way to find the root cause is to sketch the
          problem as an{" "}

            <u>issue tree</u>
          </a>
          . Start with the more promising part, for instance, revenues - because
          the market is highly{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/competitive-response">
            <u>competitive</u>
          </a>
          . Obviously, you would share that thought with your interviewer and be
          on the lookout for hints. For example: ‚ÄúI am going to look at revenues
          first, since in a competitive market like the market for chewing gums,
          I‚Äôd expect this to be a big driver.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          You can further break down the <strong>profit tree</strong> like
          below:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img

          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          <br />
          Now you can start with one of the branches. Let's take the revenue
          side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to start with the branch of the tree that also has the biggest
          impact on the case solution. Share your hypothesis with the
          interviewer and watch out for hints if you are on the right track.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Analyze the revenue side</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand the revenue side of the chewing gum manufacturer,
          segment the revenue streams. You can ask the interviewer whether you
          can segment the revenues into its component parts. If the interviewer
          prompts you to do the segmentation, you can think about different
          customer segments (small business / large business, etc., age group,
          sex, etc‚Ä¶), product lines, or regions (South America, Asia, etc.).
          This segmentation will help you isolate the root of the problem.
          You'll be able to develop better and more targeted analyzes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help the chewing gum manufacturer improve her profitability, you
          may ask: ‚ÄúWhat are the revenue sources?‚Äù. The interviewer tells you
          that all revenue comes from two products: Flavored and non-flavored
          chewing gums. At this point, you might want to know the development of
          sales over the past couple of years. ‚ÄúHow have sales figures developed
          over the years for both products?‚Äù She shares the following diagram
          with you:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">

          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          <br />
          It now becomes clear that revenue is not the problem because it has
          grown steadily in recent years. Therefore, it must be costs that rose
          significantly, leading to a drop in profitability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Analyze the cost side</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now explore the cost side. You know that costs can be broken down into{" "}

          </a>
          . You can then inquire about the breakdown of costs: "Please tell me
          about the direct/indirect cost split for the products.‚Äù The
          interviewer hands you the following graph:

          As we know that there are two different product lines, it is advisable
          to calculate their margins to check if there is a more profitable
          product line.&nbsp;
        </p>

          The root cause of the profitability problem becomes clear: ‚ÄúAnalysis
          show that the product whose sales have increased (flavored chewing
          gum) is also the one with lower margins due to the added flavor.
          Therefore, total profit margins have decreased while sales have
          increased.‚Äù

          <strong>5. Close the profitability case</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After you have determined the root cause, you must develop a good
          logical solution&nbsp; (e.g., developing a{" "}

          , starting a marketing initiative, etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to stay structured even if you think you have reached
          the final stage. Therefore, categorize your approaches, for instance

          <li>
            Look for other suppliers (form partnerships or buy greater amounts
            with batch discounts).
          </li>
        </ul>

            The client could also increase the price of the flavored gum,

            Key Takeaways - 7 Tips to Ace Your Profitability Case with
            Confidence
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Profitability problems are frequent in consulting case interviews and
          nothing to worry about. We have summarized the 7 most important tips
          to keep in mind when solving profitability cases:
          <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Understanding the business model of your client</strong> and
            adjusting your approach according to the company‚Äôs needs is crucial
            to success. The standard profitability framework can be a good base
            to structure your case, but needs to be customized
            individually.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Profitability equals revenues minus costs</strong>. Use this
            profit formula to build an issue tree and tackle down the root cause
            of your problem (but don‚Äôt forget about tip 1).&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quantify your problem</strong> and look for trends. Locate
            the biggest driver of your profitability issue and prioritize it in
            your analysis.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Combine quantitative and qualitative analysis </strong>to
            not only identify facts, but also understand the reasons
            behind.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep the big picture in mind</strong> when recommending
            actions to improve the client‚Äôs profitability. The most obvious may
            not always be the most sustainable and best solution in the long
            run.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay structured</strong> in everything you do and make sure
            you communicate your thoughts clearly to the interviewer. This
            applies to all cases and is the most important skill to master prior
            to your interviews (and the actual consulting job as well).&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practice makes perfect:</strong> Solve one or two
            profitability cases on your own and then make sure to connect with
            peers and practice together. There is no better way to not only get
            into the habit of thinking like a consultant, but communicating like
            one as well. You will receive valuable feedback and improve your
            abilities much faster than with self-study only. Find plenty of case
