          <strong>
            Apply these Shortcuts to Impress Your Interviewer with Outstanding
            Mental Math Skills
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The best way to prepare for the quantitative portion of{" "}
          <a href="/en/articles/case-interview">case interviews</a> is to{" "}
          <strong>practice the types of calculations</strong> you will need to
          perform with numbers representative of actual Case Numbers and to be
          familiar with the types of problems you are most likely to encounter
          and how to solve them. As a reminder, candidates cannot use
          calculators or spreadsheets in the case interviews but may use{" "}
          <strong>pen and paper</strong>. All the Case Calculations take this
          into account, so Case Numbers and Case Calculations usually have
          certain characteristics you can use to simplify the calculations (if
          you are familiar with certain calculation methods).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, Case Numbers are usually round numbers with only a few
          significant digits, such as 300,000 or 4,000,000. While some people
          may be intimidated by having to do calculations with large numbers
          like this without a calculator, once you learn how to{" "}
          <strong>efficiently manage the zeroes</strong>, calculations with
          numbers like these become straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Case Numbers have more than one significant digit, they usually
          have additional <strong>properties</strong> that can make certain
          calculations like multiplication and division much easier if you are
          aware of the appropriate methods. For example, let’s say you are told
          a company sells a product for $32 per unit and sells 25,000 units per
          year, and you are asked to calculate the revenue. You would then need
          to do the calculation: ($32 × 25,000). Most people would use pen and
          paper for this calculation. You can make the pen-and-paper calculation
          more efficient by not writing out the three zeroes from “25,000” and
          then adding them to the end of the result of (32 × 25).
        </p>
        <p>
          These numbers are representative of actual Case Numbers, and here is
          an efficient method for this calculation (32 × 25). First decompose 25
          as: (25 = ¼ × 100). Then we perform the calculation using this{" "}
          <strong>decomposition</strong> of 25.
        </p>
        <p>32 × ¼ = 32 ÷ 4 = 8</p>
        <p>8 × 100 = 800</p>
        <p>
          Therefore (32 × 25 = 800) - you can check this with a calculator or
          pen-and-paper calculation. You can think of this new calculation
          method as follows: let’s say you are given 32 quarters (U.S. coins);
          how much money would you have? You might think to yourself: “Well, 4
          quarters make 1 dollar, and 32 ÷ 4 = 8, so I would have $8,” which is
          correct. Now think about how many cents are in $8. The answer is
          clearly 800: (8 × 100 = 800), as there are 100 cents in 1 dollar. So
          32 quarters make $8, which is 800 cents. Now a quarter is also worth
          25 cents, and since we have 32 quarters, then 32 × 25 = 800. So to
          multiply any number by 25, you divide the number by 4 and then
          multiply by 100. This method works because (4 × 25 = 100); so, when
          you divide 32 by 4, the result is the “number of groups of 100.” Now
          the answer to our original problem of ($32 × 25,000) is then $800,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using this method relies&nbsp;on the fact that 25 = ¼ × 100. These
          numbers are representative of actual Case Numbers, and most actual
          multiplication calculations in case interviews involve numbers like
          25,000 or 25 Million, for which there is a way to{" "}
          <strong>dramatically simplify</strong> the calculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many case interview preparation resources have example calculations
          that you are highly unlikely to encounter in an actual case interview,
          such as multiplying by a number like 23,487, which has five
          significant digits and no clear way to simplify the calculation.
          Practicing quantitative problems that are not representative of actual
          Case Numbers of Case Calculations is not an effective way to prepare,
          as you won’t be practicing for what you will actually face in an
          interview. If the practice problems involve numbers with many
          significant digits, this becomes <strong>over-kill</strong> as you
          just practice brute-force mechanical calculations, and don’t practice
          the logical problem-solving aspects, and don’t get experience looking
          for and finding efficient calculation methods.
        </p>
        <h2>Mental Math Skills Are Extremely Valuable in Case Interviews</h2>
        <p>
          Because you cannot use calculators in case interviews — and because
          you may need to perform a large number of math operations — being able
          to do calculations mentally (without relying on pen and paper for the
          mechanics of calculations) is a very helpful skill in case interviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the following example,&nbsp;where you are given Price,
          Quantity and Profit Margin for three different products and asked to
          calculate the percentage of the firm’s overall revenue and profit
          contributed by each product:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img
            src="/uploads/bootcamp/74/type-conversion-1677765549-hnqjo40wzg41.webp"
            alt="type-conversion-1677765549-hnqjo40wzg41.webp"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Let’s say your approach to answering this question is to first
          calculate the revenue and profit for each product. If you can do these
          operations mentally (and write down the answers) rather than writing
          out all the multiplication operations in longhand, you will have a
          large advantage in calculation speed. Longhand multiplication refers
          to doing a multiplication calculation like 7 × 25 as shown below:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img src="/uploads/cases/143/images/formula1%281%29.JPG" alt="" />
        </figure>
        <p>
          If you need to do each multiplication operation from the above problem
          in longhand format, you would first need to copy the multiplication
          terms from the table onto pen and paper, and then do the calculation.
          Since calculating the revenue and profit for each product requires a
          large number of multiplication operations, a person who needs to do
          each multiplication operation in longhand format will be much slower
          than a person who can do the calculations mentally. It is much faster
          and more efficient to
          <strong> simply do each calculation mentally</strong> (without writing
          the original numbers out in longhand format) and then write down the
          result. The speed improvement of mental calculations is magnified if
          you need to multiply several numbers together when calculating a
          value.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example:{" "}
          <i>
            <strong>Profit</strong>
          </i>{" "}
          = (
          <i>
            <strong>Price</strong>
          </i>
          ) × (
          <i>
            <strong>Quantity</strong>
          </i>
          ) × (
          <i>
            <strong>Profit</strong> <strong>Margin</strong>
          </i>
          )
        </p>
        <p>
          For mental calculations, it is very helpful to “mentally picture” the
          numbers with which you are calculating —which I may refer to as
          “thinking” of a certain number or numbers. After doing a calculation
          mentally, you should always write down the result so you don’t forget
          it.
        </p>
        <h2>Addition and Subtraction Methods</h2>
        <p>
          Given that the Case Numbers have few significant digits—and often have
          trailing significant digits of “5,” “25” or “75”—performing addition
          and subtraction with Case Numbers is relatively straightforward for
          most people. You may want to practice adding and subtracting numbers
          if you are rusty or don’t feel confident in being able to do this
          smoothly in an interview, which has added stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Add the following numbers: 250 Million, 300
          Million, and 150 Million.
        </p>
        <h3>Methods for adding large numbers:</h3>
        <p>
          A helpful method for adding large numbers is to calculate with Units
          like Thousand (<i>K</i>), Million (<i>M</i>), Billion (<i>B</i>), and
          Trillion (<i>T</i>):
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Units</strong>
        </p>
        <p>K: Thousand</p>
        <p>M: Million</p>
        <p>B: Billion</p>
        <p>T: Trillion</p>
        <p>
          When adding large numbers, don’t write out (or mentally picture the
          number with) all the zeroes; simply write (or mentally picture) the{" "}
          <strong>leading digits</strong> and an abbreviation for the unit. For
          example, to represent “250 Million”—which, in long-form, would be
          written as “250,000,000”—write/think “250 M,” or mentally remember the
          Unit and do the calculations and, when you write down the result,
          include the appropriate Unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case interviews, if you are given printed sheets with numerical
          values or tables of numbers, the printout will usually not include all
          the zeroes for a number like 25 Million; it will use a Unit like
          “Million” or the table will indicate the values are in “Millions”
          without writing out all the zeroes.
        </p>
        <p>Using these Units, the prior example becomes:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img src="/uploads/cases/143/images/formula2%281%29.JPG" alt="" />
        </figure>
        <p>The answer is 700 Million.</p>
        <h2>Multiplication methods</h2>
        <p>
          Multiplication is the <strong>most important quant skill</strong> to
          practice for case interviews because you will frequently have to
          perform numerous multiplication operations - sometimes involving three
          or more terms. You can improve your speed and efficiency with
          multiplication while reducing errors by learning and practicing a few
          efficient calculation methods. Below are a few examples of how to
          apply efficient calculation methods to case interview multiplication
          calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example: Calculate 160&nbsp;× 350 M</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing this calculation out in longhand with all the zeroes is a
          slow, error-prone process, as many people will make a mistake with the
          number of zeroes. It is also difficult to do this calculation mentally
          while keeping track of all the zeroes, and people frequently make a
          similar error regarding the number of zeroes with a mental
          calculation, which causes the answer to be off by a factor of 10 or
          more. This is clearly a very bad mistake to make in a job interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            <strong>FastMath</strong>
          </i>
          <strong> Solution Method</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <i>FastMath</i> Solution Method is different from how most people
          would approach this, but each step is very simple:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 1:</strong> What’s 160 ÷ 2
        </p>
        <p>Answer: 160 ÷ 2 = 80</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 2: </strong>What’s 350 <strong>× </strong>2
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: 350 <strong>× </strong>2 = 700
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 3:</strong> What’s 80 <strong>× </strong>700
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: 80 <strong>× </strong>700 = 56,000
        </p>
        <p>
          Guess what? That’s the same answer as{" "}
          <strong>160 × 350 — you can check it with a calculator!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We get the answer by cutting 160 in half, which is 80, and doubling
          350, which is 700, and multiplying these results<strong> (</strong>80{" "}
          <strong>× </strong>700). &nbsp;This is called the{" "}
          <strong>Halve and Double</strong> Method.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the answer to the original problem is 56,000 Million, which is 56
          Billion.
        </p>
        <h3>Bullet Operator for Multiplication</h3>
        <p>
          To improve the readability of equations, we may use the “bullet” (also
          called the “dot”) symbol “⋅” to indicate multiplication. Therefore,
          the equation (20 × 4 = 80) could be written as (20 ⋅ 4 = 80) with the
          bullet/dot symbol. This can improve the readability of equations where
          you are multiplying the number of terms as the dot symbol is smaller
          than the cross symbol “×” and so it’s easier to read variable names
          and numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example: Calculate 125 ⋅ 2.5 ⋅ 4</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Another method useful for multiplying numbers is to reorder the
          multiplication operations into a different sequence that is easier to
          calculate. We can multiply these numbers in this sequence:
        </p>
        <p>125 ⋅ 4 = 500</p>
        <p>500 ⋅ 2.5 = 1,250</p>
        <p>The answer is 1,250.</p>
        <p>
          We’ll call this the <strong>“Reordering” method</strong>, and it uses
          the mathematical property that, when multiplying a set of numbers, the
          order in which you multiply terms doesn’t matter; we’ll call this
          property the Reordering Property of multiplication. There are many
          potential ways in which you can Reorder the multiplication terms, and
          you can choose the order that is easiest for the particular numbers
          involved. There may be multiple efficient/effective ways to Reorder
          multiplication terms, and there is no single “correct” sequence. We
          could also calculate this as follows:
        </p>
        <p>2.5 ⋅ 4 = 10</p>
        <p>125 ⋅ 10 = 1,250</p>
        <p>
          Most people find these new orders are much easier to execute than
          multiplying the first pair of numbers in the original calculation (125
          ⋅ 2.5).
        </p>

        <h2>Division Methods</h2>
        <p>
          Some Case Calculations require division, and you frequently need to
          express the result as a percentage. There is usually a way to simplify
          the division Case Calculations, so you frequently don’t need to use
          Long Division. Candidates should still be familiar with and be
          prepared to use Long Division if they cannot find a simplification
          method, and candidates may encounter some Case Calculations where
          traditional Long Division is appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are a few examples of how to apply efficient calculation methods
          to division Case Calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example: Calculate 42 Billion ÷ 500</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing the calculation using Long Division and writing out all the
          zeroes is a slow, error-prone process. It is also difficult to do this
          calculation purely mentally because of all the zeroes.
        </p>
        <p>First, we write 42 Billion using our units, which becomes 42 B.</p>
        <p>Second, we treat 500 as: (500 = ½ ⋅ 1,000 = ½ ⋅ K)</p>
        <p>Then we calculate using this “decomposition” of 500.</p>
        <p>
          42 <i>B</i> ÷ <i>K</i> = 42 <i>M&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>(since <i>B</i> ÷{" "}
          <i>K</i> = <i>M</i>)
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we need to divide by ½, which is the same as multiplying by 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          42 <i>M</i> ⋅ 2 = 84 <i>M</i>
        </p>
        <p>The answer is 84 Million.</p>
        <p>
          To divide by 1,000 (<i>K</i>), we simply do the inverse of multiplying
          by 1,000 (<i>K</i>) and decrease the Unit size. Hence: (<i>B</i> ÷{" "}
          <i>K</i> = <i>M</i>). We could do these operations in any order, so we
          could multiply by 2 first, and then divide by{" "}
          <i>
            <strong>K</strong>
          </i>
          .
        </p>
        <h2>Multiplying and Dividing with “Clean” Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          Many of the Case Numbers involved in multiplication and/or division
          calculations in{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview">
            case interviews
          </a>{" "}
          will have special properties and are what we will call “Clean
          Numbers,” defined as being a “Clean Fraction” times an Integer power
          of 10. In this context, a “Clean Fraction” means both the numerator
          and denominator (what we will call the “elements” of the fraction) are{" "}
          <strong>non-zero integers</strong> that are each smaller than 10
          -&nbsp;and often smaller than 5.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the number 25 can be represented as ¼ ⋅ 100; hence, 25 is
          a Clean Number, as the elements of the fraction are “1” and “4”, which
          are both smaller than 5. Below are some examples of how to express
          certain numbers as Clean Fractions times an Integer power of 10,
          showing that they are Clean Numbers:

        <p>A few things to note about Clean Numbers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Numerator can be larger than 1, as shown with 75 = ¾ ⋅ 100.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Numerator can be larger than the Denominator, as shown with 150.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Integer exponent of 10 can be positive or negative
            <strong>,</strong> as shown with 0.05—which has a negative exponent
            of 10.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can represent percentages as a Clean Fraction, as shown with
            2.5%.
          </li>
          <li>
            33% and 67% are approximately equal to ⅓ and ⅔, respectively (the
            symbol “≈” means “approximately equal to.” These fractions are
            actually repeating decimals, but, in case interviews, you can often
            round these percentage values to these Clean Fractions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are specific efficient calculation methods you can learn and
          apply to make multiplying and dividing with Clean Numbers much easier
          than traditional calculation methods. The key concept of these
          efficient calculation methods is to identify Clean Numbers and
          multiply/divide with them while expressing them as a Clean Fraction
          times a power of 10. Keep in mind that, when multiplying two numbers,
          only one number needs to be a Clean Number to use these efficient
          calculation methods. With the example of 250 ⋅ 120 M, only 250 is a
          Clean Number.

        <h2>Percentage Growth Methods</h2>
        <p>
          Example:&nbsp;A company had annual revenue of $400 Million in the past
          calendar year, and their revenue is projected to grow at 4% per year.
          Approximately, what will the company’s revenue be six years in the
          future?
        </p>
        <p>
          The most efficient way to approximate the answer is to{" "}
          <strong>ignore compounding</strong>, which we will call the
          “non-compounding approximation”. Since the revenue grows 4% per year,
          for six years, if we ignore compounding, total revenue would grow by
          (4% ⋅ 6 = 24%). Since compounding will contribute slightly more
          growth, it is appropriate to round the total growth to 25%, which is
          ¼. Since the original revenue is $400 <i>M,</i> the net change in
          revenue is 25% ⋅ $400 <i>M</i> = $100 <i>M</i>. Therefore, the revenue
          in six years is $500 <i>M</i> = ($400 <i>M</i> + $100 <i>M</i>).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is appropriate to ignore compounding when the percentage change and
          the number of years of growth are relatively small. The{" "}

          <strong>&nbsp;</strong>online course explains in further detail when
          you can use the non-compounding approximation and provides additional
          methods for performing percentage-growth calculations when it’s not
          appropriate to use this approximation.
        </p>
        <h2>Net Present Value (NPV) Methods</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/net-present-value-npv">
            NPV
          </a>{" "}
          Example 1: How much would your company be willing to pay for another
          company that generates $20 Million in profit annually, if your firm
          requires an annual return on investment of 10%?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a formula to determine the net NPV for a perpetuity, which is
          a fixed payment that occurs annually ($<i>C</i>), for a given required
          annual return or interest rate (<i>r</i>), which is
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img src="/uploads/cases/143/images/formula4%281%29.JPG" alt="" />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Given that <i>r </i>=10%,
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img src="/uploads/cases/143/images/formula5%281%29.JPG" alt="" />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Therefore, <i>NPV</i> = 10 ⋅ $<i>C</i> = 10 ⋅ $20 <i>M</i> = $200{" "}
          <i>M</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your company would therefore be willing to pay up to $200 Million to
          acquire this firm.
        </p>
        <p>
          NPV Example 2: A real estate development firm is evaluating a project
          that involves buying a parcel of land and building condominiums on
          that parcel. The company forecasts they can sell the condominiums for
          a total of $250 Million six years in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is the maximum the real estate company would be willing to spend
          now to buy the land and develop the condominiums, if all the
          associated costs for the project would be incurred today, and they
          require a 12% annual return on invested capital?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a trickier NPV calculation than the prior one, as this is not
          a perpetuity, and we have to determine the NPV of a payment of $250{" "}
          <i>M</i> in six years. There is a concept called the Rule of 72, which
          tells us that something growing at 12% annually will double in
          approximately six years, as: (6 ⋅ 12 = 72). In general, the doubling
          time for a quantity will be approximately 72 divided by the percentage
          growth rate (expressed as an integer) - in this example, 72 ÷ 12 = 6.
          This approximation is accurate for percentage growth in the range of
          0%–20%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the NPV of a payment of $250 M in six years, with a
          required return of 12%, is exactly half the future payment value of
          $250 M, which is $125 M.
