        <p>
          Qualitative and quantitative analysis are{" "}
          <strong>
            two basic methods in research and data analysis that are often used
            in different scientific disciplines
          </strong>
          . These two approaches require different methods in data collection
          and they have different goals. They allow researchers to gain
          comprehensive insights into complex phenomena. For example,{" "}
          <strong>
            a company can use the findings to better understand a target group
            with its needs
          </strong>
          , or one can evaluate their effectiveness.&nbsp; Thus,{" "}

            both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis are important

          .
        </p>
        <p>
          In this text, the importance and application of these methods will be
          highlighted. Since significance and representativeness, as well as the

          , play an important role in assessing the quality and significance of
          research results, these terms will first be explained.

        <p>
          In statistics,{" "}
          <strong>
            the term "significance" refers to the importance or relevance of
            observations or differences in the data
          </strong>
          . Significance indicates whether the observed results in a study are
          likely due to true effects, or simply represent random variation. If a
          result is significant, it means that there is a low probability that
          it was caused by pure luck or chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example</strong>: Suppose a study is conducted to see if a new
          drug treatment improves the cure rate of a particular disease compared
          to the conventional treatment. After{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/practice-your-basics/why-math-matters">
            analyzing the data
          </a>
          , it is found that the group receiving the new drug had a
          significantly higher cure rate than the group receiving the
          conventional treatment. This means that the differences in cure rates
          are not due to chance or luck, but are indicative of the true effect
          of the new drug.

            A study is considered representative if it is able to accurately
            reflect the characteristics and attributes of the population being
            studied

          . To be representative, several characteristics must be met,
          including:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Random sampling</strong>: participants should be randomly
            selected to ensure that each person in the population has an equal
            chance of being included in the study. This helps to avoid bias.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Large sample size</strong>: the larger the sample, the more
            likely it is to reflect the true diversity and heterogeneity of the
            population. However, there is no set minimum size as this depends on
            the research question and the population.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Representative characteristics</strong>: Participants should
            have characteristics similar to those of the population as a whole.
            This may include gender, age, ethnicity, and other relevant factors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Random assignment</strong>: In experimental studies, the
            assignment of participants to different groups (e.g., control group
            and experimental group) should also be randomized to minimize bias.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Minimizing selection bias</strong>: it is important to
            ensure that participants have the opportunity to participate in the
            study and that selection is not influenced by certain limitations or
            biases.
          </li>

          Overall,{" "}
          <strong>

          and are not limited to the selected sample. If a phenomenon had only
          been observed in one or two males, for example a particular buying

        </p>
        <p>
          To be able to speak of a significant sample size in a scientific
          context,{" "}
          <strong>
            it is also important to distinguish causality from correlation
          </strong>
          . Causality implies an actual cause-effect relationship, while
          correlation is only a statistical relationship between variables.
          Thus, a significant sample size alone does not necessarily mean that
          one can prove causality. Especially in the changed purchasing behavior
          after an advertising campaign for a new vegan ice cream, one cannot
          conclude that the advertising campaign for the ice cream and for more
          animal welfare alone led to higher sales figures. Possibly it was also
          the warm weather, or an{" "}

          In practice, it is not possible in most cases to establish strictly
          causal relationships between marketing activities and results, because
          many factors are at work at the same time. Therefore, marketing
          professionals often focus on analyzing correlations. A sufficiently
          large sample is necessary to identify statistically significant
          correlations and to detect trends.&nbsp;

            <strong>keyword effectiveness (quantitative)</strong>: Quantitative
            analysis is critical to evaluate keyword performance in search

            rates, average cost per click (CPC) and return on investment (ROI)

            quality of the ad itself, such as the text and landing page. This is
            crucial because search engines use the quality factor to determine
            ad rankings.

          <li>
            <strong>A/B testing (quantitative)</strong>: To compare different ad

            variation performs best.
