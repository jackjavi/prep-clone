            You Need Good Math Skills to Succeed in Your Consulting Case
            Interviews
          </strong>

        <h2>
          Basic&nbsp;math skills will be tested in all case interviews, so you
          need to practice mental math,&nbsp;especially if it&nbsp;is not your

        </h2>
        <p>
          One of the basic skills a candidate requires is good mental math
          abilities. Your interviewer will <strong>test this skill</strong>
          &nbsp;either directly by asking a math question such as "What is the
          square root of 759?" or in an indirect manner while solving a business
          case problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interviewers can differentiate between hard and soft mistakes.
          Calculation errors are considered&nbsp;<strong>hard mistakes</strong>
          &nbsp;because there is no partial answer in math. Therefore, you must
          improve or refresh your mental math skills before interviews.
          Remember, it is alright to use scratch paper for most calculations,
          but it is expected that you are able to mentally perform easy
          calculations. &nbsp;Try the following tool to improve your mental math
          skills.&nbsp;

        <h2>Impress the interviewer with outstanding mental math skills</h2>
        <p>
          Possessing excellent mental math skills is crucial during a{" "}
          <a href="/articles/case-interview">case interview</a> because you will
          need these skills as a consultant. &nbsp;In general, there are two
          main reasons why consultants should possess excellent math skills:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            As a consultant, you will come across several occasions in which you
            will need mental math skills. Estimation skills can
            <strong>&nbsp;save a lot of time&nbsp;</strong>and, in some cases,
            help figure out unnecessary&nbsp;analysis that can waste a lot of
            time if a quick estimation is not done (see 80/20 or{" "}
            <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/pareto-principle">
              pareto principle
            </a>
            ). Without excellent math skills, you could end up spending the
            entire night using Excel.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can easily&nbsp;<strong>impress </strong>your client by
            demonstrating to them that you are a{" "}
            <strong>potential math genius</strong>. Clients often pay a lot of
            money to you (or your employer) and expect real wisdom and
            cleverness. Quick math solutions can be an effective way to convince
            clients of your recommendations.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>
          Math or "quant" skills account for 20-25% of overall performance
          evaluation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Quant's skills are only one of the skills assessed in case interviews.
          As a candidate, you are evaluated on your overall combination of
          skills and your perceived potential. Generally, a candidate’s
          quantitative assessment consists of <strong>20-25%</strong> of the{" "}
          <strong>overall</strong> interview evaluation weight. The goal of
          Management Consulting firms is to find the set of candidates with what
          they perceive is the best set of skills overall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most firms have a “minimum bar” for quant skills for their candidates,
          which means you are unlikely to receive an offer if you do not exceed
          this bar—unless you are otherwise a <strong>highly</strong>{" "}
          <strong>exceptional</strong> candidate (such as being a Rhodes
          Scholar). At some firms, dramatically exceeding this “bar” does{" "}
          <strong>not</strong> strengthen your candidacy—that is, the
          quantitative evaluation is binary: you either pass the quant
          assessment or you don’t. At other firms, such as McKinsey, if you can
          demonstrate very strong quantitative skills, it will differentiate you
          from other candidates. The quant problems from these firms can be more
          complex, which allows candidates with strong quant skills to fully
          demonstrate their ability. The corollary is that, for some very
          complex quant problems, you <strong>don’t</strong> need to correctly
          solve all the components to receive an offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relative importance of quantitative skills in the case interview
          varies by firm, office, and individual interviewer. As an example, if
          you are interviewing with a consulting firm partner who has a Ph.D. in
          a very quantitative field like Applied Mathematics or Physics, they
          may ask more challenging quant questions and place a greater emphasis
          on quant skills in their interviews. McKinsey, in particular, places
          more emphasis on quant skills than other firms, and, as mentioned
          previously, demonstrating exceptional quant skills can significantly
          strengthen your candidacy at McKinsey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the large weighting of 20-25% that quant skills have in
          consulting interviews - and the quant “minimum bar” at most consulting
          firms - you can certainly sink your chances of receiving an offer if
          you perform poorly in the quant portion of the interview.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A quant's skills are needed to be an effective Management
            Consultant; hence, they are assessed in Management Consulting
            interviews. Quant's skills are one of the skills consulting firms
            consider in their interviews
          </li>
          <li>
            At most firms, if you do not exceed a “minimum bar” for quant
            skills, it is unlikely you will receive an offer
          </li>
          <li>
            You cannot use calculators or spreadsheets in Management Consulting
            interviews, and the assessment of your quant skills usually
            contributes about 20-25% of the overall interview evaluation weight.
