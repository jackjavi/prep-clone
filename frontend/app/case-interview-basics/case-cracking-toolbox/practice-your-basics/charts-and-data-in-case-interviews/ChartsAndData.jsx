          A three-step guide to read charts and data in a case interview:
          analyze, contextualize, and interpret
        </h2>
        <p>
          While tests like the McKinsey Imbellus&nbsp;Game require you to
          calculate the answer precisely on your own, a case interview situation
          is quite different.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, you will not be asked math problems in a
          case&nbsp;interview.&nbsp;However, data in various forms is likely to
          make an appearance in many different types of cases. For example, when
          you ask for market, customer, or cost information while analyzing the
          case, the interviewer may provide you with a slide that has a few
          graphs detailing&nbsp;the various segments of the target market and
          various numbers (revenue, growth, etc.) pertaining to the segments.
          You are expected to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Analyze</strong>: Quickly understand the information
            presented in the exhibit. What is the overall size of the market?
            How much did our revenue growth in the last two years? Which
            customer segment saw the maximum fall in revenues?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contextualize</strong>: Put your understanding into the
            overall context of the case and also into the specific context of
            the current discussion. Is the market big enough, given our client’s
            existing operations? What do we know about the client that could
            explain the revenue growth? Is the new competing product, which you
            just discussed, potentially responsible for slowing down growth in a
            particular customer segment?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interpret</strong>: Present your business insights, and
            continue the case in the right direction by asking relevant
            questions. “So, it looks like the new market is 2x bigger than our
            current market and has fragmented competition. I would like to test
            a hypothesis that this is a good market to enter” “It looks like our
            client has seen revenue grow 15% over the last two years. Do we know
            which of the client’s businesses has been primarily responsible for
            this increase?” or “It seems that the new product launched by our
            competitors has cut into our share of wallet for Segment X of
            customers, reducing our market share by 20%. I would like to analyze
            why they switched”.

          This article will&nbsp;help you understand how to tackle data in a
          case interview&nbsp;by providing helpful tips on what to do at each
          stage&nbsp;with examples from real-life case exhibits.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <strong>
            Analyzing additional data given by the interviewer&nbsp;
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are three forms in which data can be presented to you in a case
          interview:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only numerical data is in a tabular form.</li>
          <li>
            Bar or pie charts with markings on the axes indicate units and
            reference data points.
          </li>
          <li>A mixture of tabular and graphic representations of data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Making sense of this information requires the same skills you will
          practice for the problem-solving test. Let’s start with an example:
        </p>
        <p>
          For a boot manufacturer that manufactures two types of boots, you have
          to plan a strategy for responding to a competitor who has launched a
          new product. To understand the market, you ask the interviewer how big
          it is. The exhibit below is presented to you.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <figure class="image">

          />
        </figure>
        <figure class="image">
          <img
            src="/uploads/bootcamp/72/type-conversion-1677833999-l2yu8695vs7a.webp"
            alt="type-conversion-1677833999-l2yu8695vs7a.webp"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Take the following steps to analyze this data:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep in mind the question</strong> you asked the interviewer
            (and the overall situation) when he handed you the exhibit.
            &nbsp;Your primary job is to answer that question! In this case, the
            question is market size – a Euro figure. So you must assimilate all
            the customer segmentation, product, and pricing data into the total
            market size.
          </li>
          <li>
            First,&nbsp;<strong>read the title of the exhibit</strong> and then
            study the axes and units of the data (for charts). This will tell
            you what exactly the data is about. You can see that this exhibit is
            a mixed chart with both numerical and graphical representations of
            data. The first part shows buying propensity (in other words, the
            percentage of the population that bought boots last year). Quickly
            note that the data is presented as a percentage for different
            customer segments, and you also have the average price paid and
            total population for each segment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Figure out the <strong>most efficient approach</strong> to get to
            the final result, and work the math. If all the required data is not
            present, ask for it.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In this case,</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Total revenue from all customers would equal market size.</li>
          <li>Total revenue = Number of boots bought * Price per pair</li>
          <li>
            Number of boots bought = Number of buyers * Boots bought per buyer
          </li>
          <li>
            Number of buyers = (Total Population) * (% of the population buying
            boots)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Now, do we have all information required to calculate the revenue? No!
          We need to know the number of boots bought per capita by each consumer
          segment. Quickly explain your approach to the interviewer and ask for
          the required information. Suppose he asks you to assume that every
          customer bought just one pair of boots in the last year. Now you have
          all the information needed to calculate the market size for the total
          boots category. However, you cannot calculate the size of the Work /
          Casual boots market separately since you only know the overall average
          price and not the category average for each. (While these individual
          prices for the categories can be calculated using simultaneous
          equations, this is definitely overkill for a case interview, and you
          should ask the interviewer for this information to calculate the
          different segments.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Look at the graph for other interesting trends</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you’ve achieved the main objective, you should look at the other
          obvious trends that the data shows. Get a general sense of the
          situation depicted, and look for trends across categories/years or
          major aberrations. Don’t spend more than 5 seconds studying the graph
          unless you see something especially striking or confusing. In this
          case, for example, a basic observation is that blue-collar workers buy
          more work boots than casual boots, and since they are paying more than
          the others on average, it could mean that work boots cost more than
          casual boots. Another observation is that the work boot category is
          significantly larger than the casual boot category.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Now that you have some numbers and an idea of the general trends shown
          by the data, you need to put it in the context of the overall case.
          This means understanding the business implication of the given data.
          Sometimes at the end of the analysis stage, you may realize that the
          data given to you has too many implications. Which are the ones most
          relevant to the case and current discussion? The following steps can
          help add more context to your analysis. Let us continue with{" "}

          company discussed in the last section:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Think of the overall objective, and make a quick hypothesis about
            the key metrics required to assess the situation. To understand the
            competitive dynamics of the market, we would need to figure out the
            key product categories in the market and our company’s positioning
            with customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Understand what the data says about the metrics you have just
            identified. We understand that the boot market is divided into two
            segments based on the type of usage, and the customers are segmented
            by profession.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to think of reasons that might have caused the data to look like
            it does and open new lines of inquiry. This helps the interviewer
            understand that you can not only do math but can also draw business
            inferences from the exhibit – which is a key skill a consultant
            should possess. In this case, it stands to reason that more
            blue-collar workers will buy work boots since their professions
            require more manual effort, and thus their shoes will wear out
            earlier. Also, what is our client’s overall standing in the two boot
            segments? – that’s the natural next question.

            Interpreting and communicating your insights to the interviewer
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The final and most important step is synthesizing all the analysis and
          business reasoning that you just completed and presenting it to the
          interviewer in an effective manner. The following aspects should be
          taken care of while communicating the inferences to the interviewer:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Consulting is hypothesis-driven, and
            you should try to lead with a preliminary conclusion backed by the
            information you currently have, which can be verified by asking for
            more information. Ask for the further information needed to verify
            your hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data</strong>: If you have been presented with numbers and
            have made mathematical calculations, it makes sense to present the
            most important results to the interviewer to show your comfort with
            numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clarity &amp; Logic</strong>: The communication needs to be
            precise and logical. You have to explain the logic behind your
            conclusions. In general, it often helps to think aloud so that the
            interviewer can follow your line of reasoning.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In this case, the situation can be possibly summed up as follows:</p>
        <p>
          The total market size is €X Mn. My hypothesis is that the work boots
          category is the most important for us here since it is €Y Mn larger
          than the casual boots segment. Do we have any information about our
          market share and that of our competitors in each of these segments?
