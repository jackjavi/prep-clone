          <strong>
            There Is No Advanced Math Required in Case Interviews, but
            Calculating Quickly Is a Real Challenge
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Nearly all the math required in a{" "}
          <a href="/articles/case-interview">case interview</a> is arithmetic:
          addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You will likely
          need to perform these calculations with percentages, decimals or
          fractions, and calculate a percentage value (which requires division).
          Most candidates understand these math concepts; the{" "}
          <strong>challenge</strong> for many people is performing multiple
          calculations with large numbers{" "}
          <strong>quickly and without calculators</strong> or spreadsheets, in a
          high-pressure environment with a six-figure salary and your future
          career on the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If practiced, the maths part of the case interview can be completed
          competently and without much stress. Demonstrating good maths skills
          can be your <strong>differentiator in your interview</strong> so it is
          worth spending the time to practice. &nbsp;Being quick is not only a
          major plus for your performance but it also helps keep a natural flow
          to your interview, helping you{" "}
          <strong>build rapport with your interviewer</strong>.<br />
          Good mental maths skills are particularly useful in market
          sizing/guesstimate questions and consulting case studies.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>​</p>
        <h2>Case numbers are “round” with&nbsp;few significant digits</h2>
        <p>
          The good news is that most of the numbers you encounter in case
          interviews (what we&nbsp;call “<strong>Case</strong>{" "}
          <strong>Numbers</strong>”) are “round” numbers and have only a few{" "}
          <strong>significant</strong> <strong>digits</strong> (i.e. only a few
          digits are non-zero), but may be in the Millions or Billions. For
          example, the number 200 Thousand, which is 200,000 in long-form, has a
          single-digit that is not zero (“2”), and so has one{" "}
          <strong>significant digit.</strong> The number 2.5 Million, which is
          2,500,000 in long-form, has two non-zero digits (“2” and “5”) and
          therefore has two <strong>significant digits.</strong> Case numbers
          frequently have only one or two significant digits, less frequently
          three significant digits, and in rare cases four or more significant
          digits. The term "<strong>Case</strong> <strong>Calculation</strong>"
          refers to a calculation required in a case interview, and may provide
          specific Case Numbers or refer to a general calculation without
          specifying the numbers involved, such as calculating Revenue, given
          Price, and Quantity.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Examples​</h2>
        <p>
          Here are some <strong>examples of the types of questions</strong> you
          would get in a case interview:
        </p>
        <p>​</p>
        <p>
          Q. A hairbrush manufacturer has fixed costs of £3,000,000 and they
          sell 175,000 units a year, what is the fixed cost per unit?​
        </p>
        <p>A. £3,000,000 ÷ 175,000 = £17.1​</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Q. A global software company sells products in Germany, France, and
          the US. The German market had revenues of £2.35bn last year, France
          had sales 23% higher than Germany, what were their total revenues?​
        </p>
        <p>A. £2.35bn x 1.23 = £2.89bn</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Methodologies​</h2>
        <p>
          Maths skills take practice but before you begin your practice it is
          best to choose <strong>calculation methods</strong> that you are most
          comfortable with. The method that you were taught when you were
          younger may not always be the method you want to use now.​
        </p>
        <p>
          Below we have found some methods that we think are good for speed and
          accuracy in pressure situations along with any useful tips or
          shortcuts that we are aware of.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Addition and Subtraction</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the Case Numbers you need to add and subtract will have only a
          few significant digits. If they have more than one significant digit,
          the last or “trailing” significant digits will often be “5” or “25,”
          which makes them easier to add/subtract.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 1:</strong> Add 250 Million, 300 Million, and 150
          Million.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>700 Million
        </p>
        <p>
          In this additional example, the leading digits (prior to the Million)
          are: 250, 300, and 150. These numbers have either one significant
          digit (300) or two significant digits, where the last significant
          digit is a “5,” which makes addition easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you need to add Case Numbers with three significant digits, the
          last two significant digits are often “25” or “75,” which are also
          easy to calculate with.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 2:</strong> Add 225 Million, 375 Million, and 200
          Million.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>800 Million
        </p>
        <p>
          You may need to add some Case Numbers with three significant digits
          that don’t end in “25” or “75,” but they most likely end in “5.” For
          example, you might need to add numbers like 115 and 165. Since these
          numbers both end in “5”, they are relatively easy to add without a
          calculator, and the answer is 280.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is highly <strong>unlikely</strong> you will need to add or
          subtract a series of numbers with three or more significant digits,
          where all the digits are effectively random, such as 147, 368, and 434
          (where the last significant digits are <strong>not</strong> “25” or
          “75”).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you have to do so, we recommend the{" "}
          <strong>regrouping method.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <iframe
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVtdqRNJmiw"
            width="560"
            height="315"
          ></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>regrouping method</strong> aligns the two numbers on top
          of each other by their units and then you sum each unit column to find
          the total number. It reduces the complexity of the equation down to
          single-digit additions and can be used for{" "}
          <strong>decimal places</strong> too.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          The <strong>long subtraction method</strong> we prefer is built on the
          same principle as the long addition and so you don't need to learn a
          new method but rather apply it differently. The two numbers are again
          aligned on top of each other and instead of summing each column, you{" "}
          <strong>subtract the two numbers</strong>.

        <h2>Multiplication,&nbsp;Division, and Percentages</h2>
        <p>
          As you can see from the prior examples, candidates need to perform
          multiplication and division calculations using numbers in the
          thousands, millions, or even billions (but with a limited number of
          significant digits). In case interviews, candidates often need to
          perform multiplication and/or division with percentages, decimals, and
          fractions. For example, you might need to multiply a number by a
          percentage (e.g., calculate 25% of $500 Million), or divide two
          numbers and express the result as a percentage (e.g. what percentage
          of $80 Million does $16 Million represent?). Similar operations using
          fractions instead of percentages are also frequently required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the Case Numbers you need to multiply or divide will be round
          numbers with only a few significant digits. For instance, the number
          of units sold for each product could be 5 Million, 10 Million, and
          12.5 Million. In a case interview, you are unlikely to receive a
          similar problem where the number of units sold is something like
          9,618,493, which has many significant digits that appear random. The
          percentage values you need to multiply/divide within case interviews
          will also usually have only a few significant digits. A typical Case
          Calculation would be calculating 20% or 25% of another number. It is{" "}
          <strong>unlikely</strong> you would need to calculate 23.7% of a value
          in a Case Calculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 3:</strong> Calculate $120 Million times 250.

        <h3>
          <strong>Multiplication</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Long multiplication methods have the most variance of the calculations
          but most follow the simple principle of breaking the large numbers
          into their component parts e.g. 728 is 700, 20, and 8. To keep things
          as similar as possible across the different calculations we again
          choose to work vertically with the numbers aligned by units.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <iframe

        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Division</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Division gets most difficult when dealing with{" "}
          <strong>decimals</strong> but the method we prefer allows you to
          continue into decimals seamlessly, this is particularly helpful when
          dealing with small amounts of money e.g. $3850.45, the 45 cents make
          the calculation more difficult.​
        </p>
        <p>
          This method moves away from the vertically aligned method but we find
          it easiest and most versatile for long division.
        </p>
        <p>

          ></iframe>
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Percentages</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Relativity is an important concept in consulting case interviews as a
          number on its own does not demonstrate the{" "}
          <strong>
            value of the numbers in comparison to the other number(s) in the
            question
          </strong>
          . Being able to convert to percentages is an important skill and will
          often be required in{" "}
          <a href="https://www.preplounge.com/en/case-interview">
            case interviews
          </a>
          .​
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a number of simple ways to find percentages but if you are
          stuck try finding 10%, 5%, and 1% first, using a combination of these
          amounts you will be able to find other percentages fairly quickly e.g.
          37% = (10% x 3)+5%+(1% x 2).

        <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
        <h2>Compounded Growth</h2>
        <p>
          Candidates also need to understand compound percentage growth and how
          to make approximations with compound growth. It is a very common Case
          Calculation to be given a firm’s revenue (or another metric), and the
          associated{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/cagr-compound-annual-growth-rate">
            Compound&nbsp;Annual Growth Rate
          </a>{" "}
          (CAGR), and be asked to estimate that value at some point in the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Net Present Value (NPV)</h2>
        <p>
          Another common Case Calculation involves assigning a financial value
          to monetary payments that will occur in the future. Management
          Consultants usually determine the current value of future payments
          using a financial method called Net Present Value or
          <strong> NPV.</strong> Hence, candidates need to be able to calculate
          the NPV under a variety of scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>NPV Example 1:</strong> How much would your company be willing
          to pay for another company that generates $20 Million in profit
          annually, if your firm requires an annual Return on Investment of 10%?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>$200 Million
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>NPV Example 2:</strong> A real estate development firm is
          evaluating a project that involves buying a parcel of land and
          building condominiums on that parcel. The company forecasts they can
          sell the condominiums for a total of $250 Million{" "}
          <strong>six years </strong>in the future.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          What is the maximum the real estate company would be willing to spend{" "}
          <strong>now</strong> to buy the land and develop the condominiums, if
          all the associated costs for the project would be incurred today, and
          they require a 12% annual return on invested capital?
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>More Useful Tips</h2>
        <p>
          Tackling questions like this can be daunting. To learn how to approach
          questions like this, have a look at our 5 top tips:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Don’t worry about getting the EXACT answer</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to remember that the interviewer is unlikely to be
          directly testing your maths skills, they just want to see how you
          approach the question so finding the answer to 5 decimal places is not
          important. They will usually be happy with an approximate answer,
          especially if it makes your calculations quicker.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Round the number</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have the choice, make the numbers easy for yourself. As an
          example, it is helpful to take the UK population as 60 million rather
          than its true value of 66 million. They are not always looking for
          perfect answers, just a good thought process and rough figure.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Shorten long numbers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have the opportunity to write down the numbers, shorten a
          thousand to ‘k’, million to ‘m’ and billion to ‘b’. This will help you
          write faster and keep the numbers smaller as too many 0’s can be
          confusing.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Verbalize your reasoning to the interviewer</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Explain out loud the calculation you are about to make. The
          interviewer may agree it is the right direction, they may give you
          part of the answer, or they could course correct and push you to a
          different part of the problem. It is important to give the interviewer
          the opportunity to help you as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>5. Make reasonable assumptions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Often you will be asked questions in which you are required to come up
          with the numbers yourself. These questions do not test accuracy but
          test your logic skills and common sense. As long as you are clear

          your logic and challenge it if they think they need to.
