          The 4P Framework is a powerful tool to set&nbsp;the right marketing
          mix within a case study
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Use the 4Ps to align the&nbsp;products of a company with the
          right&nbsp;price, place, and promotion
        </h2>
        <h3>
          The right&nbsp;<strong>product</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The product must meet the <strong>needs </strong>of&nbsp;customers.
          This category also includes&nbsp;<strong>packaging,</strong>&nbsp;as
          well as&nbsp;<strong>services</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
          <strong>guarantees,</strong>&nbsp;which could come with the purchase.
          The key area in this framework is to understand the&nbsp;
          <strong>distinctive characteristics</strong>&nbsp;of the product in
          comparison to the competitors' products (see{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/benchmarking">
            benchmarking
          </a>
          ).
        </p>
        <h3>
          The right&nbsp;<strong>price</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Generally, 3 different approaches are used to set the{" "}
          <a href="/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/pricing">
            price
          </a>{" "}
          of a product:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cost-Based Pricing</li>
          <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
          <li>Value-Based Pricing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The “right” price is the one, which maximizes the revenue. To sell the
          greatest amount at the best price possible, we need to know how people
          value the product; therefore&nbsp;<strong>value-based pricing</strong>
          &nbsp;is usually recommended.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The right&nbsp;<strong>place</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Place refers to the PLACEment of a product in the market rather than
          just the point of sale. This dimension includes the whole&nbsp;
          <strong>distribution system:&nbsp;</strong>transportation, storage,
          and choice of a distribution channel to the point of sale&nbsp;among
          others. To choose the right place you need to focus on the customers’
          needs, wants, and behavior.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The most effective&nbsp;<strong>promotion</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Promotion bundles all&nbsp;<strong>communication activities</strong>
          &nbsp;with the customers. Ideally, the information of a product is
          presented in such a manner that it raises awareness of the target
          group and convinces them to purchase the product. Promotional costs
          often represent a sizable proportion of the overall{" "}

            costs

          <strong>Example</strong>:&nbsp;Starbucks
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Product</strong>: a variety of caffeinated drinks and a
            distinct ambiance unavailable before Starbucks in the US.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Price</strong>: premium price because of the uniqueness in
            the American market and willingness of people to pay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Place</strong>: establishing themselves as a coffee-to-go
            place, therefore they set up coffee shops in places with a high
            frequency of walk-in customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Promotion</strong>: Starbucks is one of the most recognized
            brands today. Starbucks addresses its modern clientele using various
            kinds of advertisements such as mobile apps, social networks, and
            other types of viral marketing.
