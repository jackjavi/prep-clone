          The structure is useful to get a better understanding of the client
          and important during your{" "}
          <a href="/en/articles/case-interview">case interview</a>. While the
          former 2 provide information on external market conditions, the last 2
          provide internal information about the company. The framework belongs
          to the basic tools, which serve as a general roadmap and reminder of
          the major aspects to cover. The 3C Framework – Customer, Competition,
          and Company is very similar except that the internal aspects of cost
          and capabilities are combined within the company.

        <h2>
          Think about the 4 Cs when the case is about analyzing a market,
          entering a new market, or introducing a new product
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Within the first segment, the focus lies on the&nbsp;
          <strong>customer</strong>&nbsp;of the company
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is important to realize that the customer of the firm is not
          necessarily the end customer who buys the product. To find out more
          about the customer, questions should concentrate on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Market size in terms of revenue</li>
          <li>Growth</li>
          <li>Segmentation by geography, products and/or other segments</li>
          <li>Customer segmentation and types of customers</li>
          <li>Attractiveness in terms of revenue and expected growth</li>
          <li>Special needs and wishes</li>
          <li>Loyalty</li>
          <li>Distribution&nbsp;channels</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          The second part of the analysis should focus on the&nbsp;
          <strong>competition</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is important to understand the market position of the competitors,
          as well as how the competition differentiates itself from the client's
          company.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Competitive position, portrayed through the share and relative share
            of the market
          </li>
          <li>Growth of the last years and expected growth</li>
          <li>Fragmentation</li>
          <li>Performance, for example profitability, relatively to ours</li>
          <li>Dynamics of new entrants</li>
          <li>Other trends</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Moving to the third dimension&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>costs</strong>
          &nbsp;- the view changes from an external to an internal view
        </h3>
        <p>
          Here, we compare our client’s&nbsp;
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/fixed-variable-costs">
            cost
          </a>{" "}
          structure with the competition’s cost structure and try to reduce our
          costs if certain components of competition costs are lower.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Relative cost position, cost advantage compared to the competition
          </li>
          <li>Profitability by customers, product lines, geography</li>
          <li>

          <li>Exiting unprofitable areas</li>
          <li>Reorganization of business units</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          The fourth and last area deals with&nbsp;<strong>capabilities</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          If we have a better understanding of the resources of a company, we
          are able to judge more precisely what kind of strategies a company can
          apply to boost its performance. Furthermore, we can decide if a
          company should rather make something by itself (organic) or buy the
          competencies from outside (inorganic - e.g., buying a new firm).
          Following are some examples of the company's capabilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
