            MECE – A Guide to the MECE Principle With Applied Examples
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            MECE is a best practice method to lay down a robust structure for
            your case interview
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          MECE is a way of segmenting information into sub-elements that are{" "}
          <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>collectively exhaustive</strong>.&nbsp;In other words,
          elements should “exclude” each other, i.e. be distinct, and should
          “exhaust” the relevant field, i.e. contain everything that belongs to
          it. MECE as a method should be&nbsp;used when you craft&nbsp;an{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/issue-tree">
            issue tree
          </a>{" "}
          for your case structure. Doing so will help you{" "}
          <strong>avoid dependencies</strong> between different branches of the
          tree, and thus sub-problems can&nbsp;be properly isolated.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mutually Exclusive</strong>: aims at reducing complexity
          by&nbsp;<strong>avoiding overlaps</strong>. You need to make sure that
          the possible solutions or groups are not accidentally considered
          twice. Proving exclusiveness forces you to carefully look at each
          option, consequently leading you to a much deeper understanding of the
          issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Collectively Exhaustive:</strong>&nbsp;aims at ensuring a
          comprehensive collection without leaving alternatives. Exhaustive
          means that all possible options have been considered. The trick is to
          divide a problem into categories with a&nbsp;<strong>finite</strong>
          &nbsp;number of general groups. For example, if you need to make
          “means of transportation” MECE, don't start just collecting “per foot,
          train, plane, bicycle, bike, etc.” Try to
          <strong> find categories</strong>, because this practice will prevent
          you from forgetting important options: wheels <i>vs</i>. no wheels OR
          air <i>vs.</i> water <i>vs.</i> land.&nbsp;

          Another example for a MECE breakdown is dividing the population into
          subsets of age:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A group of people below 50 years and another group of 50 years and
            above is MECE. No person can be in both groups - mutually exclusive
            - but every person is in either one of them – collectively
            exhaustive
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A group of people below 50 years and another group with people from
            40 to 70 years is not MECE, as people from 40 to 50 years belong to
            both groups - they are not mutually exclusive – and people above 70
            are in neither one of the groups – they are not collectively
            exhaustive.

          The MECE methodology is famously used at McKinsey. McKinsey's
          interviewers along with other firms will especially look at whether

          information in a MECE format.&nbsp;During a{" "}
          <a href="/en/articles/case-interview">case interview</a>, MECE is also
          helpful for calculation. Many <strong>well-known frameworks</strong>,

          The example below, from the <strong>"Startup </strong>

            <strong>vs.</strong>
          </i>
          <strong> Consulting case"</strong> on PrepLounge, shows how costs are
          typically broken down in a MECE way. Subsequently, an&nbsp;issue
          tree-like format is used to break down the estimation into its basic
          components for easier approximation of data.
