          Porter’s Five Forces is the most common framework to assess a market's
          attractiveness in a case study
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Use Porter’s Five Forces during structuring for a thorough market
          analysis
        </h2>
        <p>
          Porter’s Five Forces is an established framework to analyze a market.
          <strong>
            {" "}
            A market is defined as a specific industry that sells similar
            products
          </strong>
          . Porter’s analysis is used to{" "}
          <strong>assess market attractiveness </strong>both for new entrants
          and existing companies. In general, the stronger the five forces are,
          the less attractive is the industry. During increased competition,
          companies need more than usual resources to survive, which ultimately
          leads to less attractiveness. The following schematic shows the
          elements of Porter's five forces.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </figure>
        <h2>Analyze different dimensions to assess the threat of each force</h2>
        <p>
          To analyze an industry, you can ask data about five forces and then
          assess their potential power in the market. During a market analysis
          in a <a href="/en/articles/case-interview">case interview</a>, ask for
          specific questions that would help in assessing the power of these
          forces.
        </p>
        <h3>Negotiating Power of Suppliers</h3>
        <p>
          The negotiating power of suppliers is defined as the amount of
          leverage the suppliers have&nbsp;for selling their products. A high
          negotiating power often leads to higher{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/pricing">
            prices
          </a>{" "}
          or lower quality, thereby lowering the potential margin of the
          industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following are some signs that a supplier has a high negotiating power:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Relatively lower threat for a supplier to get acquired by another
            company.
          </li>
          <li>
            High switching{" "}
            <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/common-terms-of-business/fixed-variable-costs">
              costs
            </a>{" "}
            for a buyer to change suppliers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Availability of only a few suppliers (or high concentration of few
            suppliers).
          </li>
          <li>
            Highly specialized supplies, no substitutes for the supplied good.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Negotiating Power of Buyers</h3>
        <p>
          This concept is analogous to the supplier power discussed above. If
          buyers have a lot of negotiating power, it generally implies strong
          leverage to enforce low prices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following are some signs that a buyer has a high negotiating power:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            High danger of backwards integration or an ability of buyers to
            produce the product easily.
          </li>
          <li>Low switching costs.</li>
          <li>
            High concentration of customers or only a few customers relative to
            a number of suppliers.
          </li>
          <li>Large volumes of products bought by a single buyer.</li>
          <li>Better or easy alternatives for buyers to switch.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Threat of New Market Entrants</h3>
        <p>
          The lower the barriers for market entry, the easier it is for new
          competitors to enter the market thus leading to higher competition and
          thereby increasing the risk of price wars and a lower margin. Hence,
          an attractive industry usually has high entry barriers. It is hard to
          enter an attractive industry, but once a company is able to enter, it
          is in a good shape.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Market entry barriers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/business-basics/grundlegende-business-begriffe/economy-of-scale-und-economy-of-scope">
              Economies of scale
            </a>{" "}
            because new entrants sell lower volumes and face higher costs per
            unit.
          </li>
          <li>
            High learning effects because established players’ experience leads
            to better contracts, operations, customer relationships.
          </li>
          <li>High capital intensity and investment costs.</li>
          <li>Governmental regulations.</li>
          <li>Competitive environment.</li>
          <li>Low accessibility to suppliers and customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Threat of Substitute Products</h3>
        <p>
          Substitute products are alternatives to products that are obviously
          different but fulfill the same customer needs. The more substitute
          products, the easier it is for the customers to switch, thereby
          leading to a more competitive environment.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Following are a few indicators for a high threat of substitute
          products:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Current products are old and at the end of the&nbsp;
            <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/product-life-cycle">
              product life cycle
            </a>
            .
          </li>
          <li>
            High comparability of substitute products and high visibility as
            substitute.
          </li>
          <li>Similar prices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rivalry within Industry</h3>
        <p>
          The level of industry rivalry is influenced by the remaining four
          forces of Porter, but is also subject to other causes. A high rivalry
          appears either as{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/identify-your-case-type/competitive-response">
            competition
          </a>{" "}
          in terms of price or in terms of quality.
        </p>
        <p>Signs of high rivalry:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Very similar products.</li>
          <li>High number of market players competing against each other.</li>
          <li>
            Low or shrinking growth as competitors fight over a saturated
            market.
          </li>
          <li>High barriers of exit due to high sunk costs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          Be cautious when applying Porter's Five Forces in a case interview
        </h2>
        <p>
          You should be aware that interviewers often see the usage of Porter's
          five forces as a forced{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/interview-first-aid/crack-the-case-interview/approaching-a-case">
            approach
          </a>{" "}
          to solve a case. As if you had no better way to structure the solution
          and had the five forces as last resort. Ideally, you should resort to
          the forces within a bigger, more general framework (e.g.{" "}
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/business-concept-library/useful-business-analysis-tools/cost-benefit-analysis">
            cost-benefit analysis
          </a>
          ). This will demonstrate to the interviewer that you are not
          "force-fitting" the case into a framework.
        </p>
