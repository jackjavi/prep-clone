        </h2>
        <p>
          During interviews, you will be given case problems that you would need
          to solve on the spot. Use a <strong>graphical</strong> issue tree (or
          logic tree) method to break a&nbsp;
          <strong>complex&nbsp;problem</strong> down into its
          <strong> component parts</strong>. Focus on the most pressing problems
          by using a&nbsp;<strong>hypothesis-driven approach</strong>. This
          approach will significantly&nbsp;<strong>increase</strong> your{" "}
          <strong>speed</strong>&nbsp;during interviews, which is a highly
          desired skill amongst consultants.&nbsp;

        <p>
          There are two types of issue trees during{" "}

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A&nbsp;<strong>problem-based tree </strong>can be used to determine
            the root cause of the problem and understand the "why" the problem
            exists.
          </li>
          <li>
            A&nbsp;<strong>solution-based tree</strong>&nbsp;can be used to
            determine the&nbsp;<strong>recommendation </strong>and understand
            the&nbsp;“how” to&nbsp;solve&nbsp;the problem.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ensure that your issues are&nbsp;
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/mece-principle">
            MECE
          </a>
          , otherwise, it would be extremely challenging to tackle each branch
          independently.&nbsp;
          <strong>Apply the hypothesis-driven&nbsp;approach</strong> to
          effectively target those issues first that matter the most&nbsp;in the
          case problem&nbsp;(see{" "}

          ).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The most desired approach in consulting is the&nbsp;
          <strong>answer-first </strong>or<strong> results-first</strong>. This
          approach is closely related to the&nbsp;
          <a href="/en/case-interview-basics/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/pyramid-principle">
            pyramid principle
          </a>
          , which states that you should{" "}
          <strong>start your recommendation&nbsp;</strong>with the
          <strong> actual solution or conclusion </strong>before justifying your
          recommendation.

        <h3>
          <strong>
            An issue tree is the foundation of all consulting projects
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Once a new project starts, you draft an issue tree of the case problem
          right away as a team. As soon as you are aligned on all underlying
          sub-problems, you force yourself to <strong>take a view</strong> and
          focus on the most important issues based on your{" "}
          <strong>hypotheses</strong> (answer-first style). Since all branches
          of the issue tree are MECE, it's relatively easy for the project
          manager to divide the overwhelming workload on
          single&nbsp;team&nbsp;members. Each branch will result in a separate{" "}
          <strong>workstream</strong> that can be executed independently. So
          there are <strong>no needless interfaces</strong> between all
          team&nbsp;members, which would create inefficiencies. That is why a
          small team of consultants <strong>gets so much done</strong> within a
          short time frame. Once the root cause of a problem is discovered, the
          case team will do the same exercise using a
          <strong> solution-based</strong> <strong>tree</strong> to find out
          what can be done <strong>to fix the problem</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine analyzing your interview scenario, in which the goal is to
          "succeed in consulting interviews”. First, you need to{" "}
          <strong>find potential issues</strong> and then&nbsp;
          <strong>break </strong>the interview process{" "}
          <strong>into its component parts </strong>as shown below.
        </p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img

          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Let’s assume you have tested the above-related hypotheses and
          determined that the primary issues lie in the speed and accuracy of
          calculations during interviews. Thus, the goal now should be to
          develop a&nbsp;<strong>solution-based</strong> issue tree to find
          potential solutions.

          <strong>Key takeaways</strong>

        <ul>
          <li>
            An issue tree is the&nbsp;<strong>most important tool</strong>
            &nbsp;for structuring your case and form hypotheses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be sure to&nbsp;
            <strong>differentiate two types of issue trees&nbsp;</strong>
            (problem-based or solution-based).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use hypotheses</strong> when analyzing your issue tree to
            come quickly to the root cause.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trees have to be&nbsp;MECE to avoid inefficient dependencies between
            branches.
